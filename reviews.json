However Tata lacks in fit and finish, you can find some shortcomings in the vehicle's finishing and fittings. They need to go through a strict inspection before putting a Tested and OK sticker. In my case, the indicator had an issue as it was blinking irregularly and when I reported this with the SC they told me that the software is not updated. Plus my window-side bidding was loose It had to be fixed at SC. I can not expect these loopholes after spending 11-12 lacs from such a big brand. My car is one month old and I am getting a mileage of 11km in the city as of now which is on the lower side. They also need to improve in customer relations.

To date Dec 2021 I have driven 34,000 Km. Overall the car is good. Few major points to highlight PROS (GOOD FOR): 1. High ground clearance. Perfect for Industrial areas where the roads are in bad shape. 2. Built tough. You don't have to worry when you are on highways. A few minor accidents were faced but nothing happened to the car. It's Solid. 3. Rich Interiors in top-end version. I think it's called Piano black finish. 4. Comfortable seating. The back seats are really good like the front ones. 5. Powerfull headlights. (Projector) CONS (BAD FOR): 1. I have faced a lot of times Push Start ON/OFF problems. It stops working suddenly in a wet climate. That's my observation. For example - When you are driving continuously for 100 km and take a break. After 5 min It shows the key is not in range and the car won't start. Then you need to push the button 5 - 6 times and then suddenly it wakes up and starts the car. This is a sheer example of POOR electrical circuit quality. This problem has occurred with a couple of my friends also who own the same car. No Solution for it to date. 2. VERY LOW MILEAGE (Petrol). I get 5-10 Kmpl in city mode and that hurts pocket a lot. The highway is fine with 15 km. 3. The infotainment system is useless. Every time you need to connect mobile through a cord and then use it. The touch screen is like old Chinese phones. They need to change it immediately 4. AMT gearbox works very slow. They should at least give a CVT a gearbox. Please don't buy AMT gearbox car. Let it be of any company. They are BAD & BORING because before this I was driving a DSG gearbox vehicle. and it was a rocket. Conclusion: Exterior update is good and it worked well in the market. But Tata needs to improve electrical parts and work on mileage because fuel is too costly now.", "author": "By ravi rathi", "date": "On: Dec 12, 2021  | 54919 Views"}

My opinion about these cars Venue - Old model with few features added with overpriced and less ground clearance with no fun in driving. Don't know why people waste their money on it Brezza - Comes with 5 gear. You would never be able to beat Nexon on the highway. No No never. Too behind in features. Nexon average is better than Brezza + Safety Sonet - Not sure if people went through the incidents of Catching fire in engines. Also overpriced with less space in legroom. If you only want to show off. Go for it. It's like paying for lacs and when u buy u realize not even worth thousands. Nexon - Finally post comparing with all of these cars and taking test drives. I bought the Great Nexon. it's great because\u00a01. It doesn't put any extra weight on your pocket. It's economic amongst others. 2. I went to Ladakh, Rishikesh, and many more places. I really like these three driving modes (Eco, Sports, and City). Sports mode gives a thrilling experience. When I was driving even Creta couldn't beat in overtaking. 3. Mileage - Eco Mode, Speed 60-75 - (22-25kmpl) City Mode, Speed 70-90 (19-22kmpl), Sports Mode, Speed 90-130 (16-19kmpl). 4. Performance - Inside cabin.

The engine likes you hard on its accelerator. Exteriors: all good with word compact SUV, other than the curvy back, which makes it's a hatchback. Interiors: plush finish looks decent gives German car finish in the interiors, all good with Audio- it's Harman nothing much to say. Pros: solidly built you will feel l seat height l comfort l Anywhere Driveability l Space l last but not least you will feel you are in a safe place Cons: mileage l Tata software technology. My Breakdown experience on the 10th day: Major software glitch caused the vehicle to stall in the main of Chennai. After using 4 cars for over a decade never had a breakdown but my 1st Tata gave it to me on the 10th day. Reason for the glitch nobody knows even in service or direct technical team.

CONS: 1. Mileage is Okish I get around 11-13 in City and 15-17 on Highway. 2. Small door pockets just to Nitpick I haven't found many Cons so far. Service: Service intervals are pretty long which is a plus point. People nagging about Tata Service Centres should change their opinion. They were really cooperative and did their work just fine.

{"modelSlug": "punch", "rating": 3.5, "title": "The Tata Punch Is A Budget-friendly Compact SUV", "content": "The Tata Punch is a mini SUV that offers a modern design and a plethora of features. It has a distinct styling that appeals to a larger audience, with its dual-tone color scheme, body cladding, and split headlight design. The Punch also received a 5-star safety rating at the Global NCAP crash test and is equipped with multiple safety features such as dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, and a high-speed alert system. However, the Punch does have some drawbacks. The steering response at highway speeds and sharper turns is lacking, and it does not come with a CNG option or a turbo petrol motor. Additionally, while it may be a budget-friendly SUV, it may not provide the power-packed performance that some buyers are looking for. One more thing - Tata Punch variants such as Pure and Adventure are lower cost, but with very few features. If you want some useful features like a back camera, infotainment screen, etc, you would have to buy a Rhythm pack (30k+ rs) or go for a higher variant that is accomplished and creative. So, in short, the lower variant should at least have a good infotainment screen, you end up paying 30-60k rs extra just for a few useful features. Here are short pros and cons for Tata Punch - Pros: 1. Good styling with SUV-like looks 2. Received a 5-star safety rating at the Global NCAP crash test 3. Equipped with a variety of features such as touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, automatic climate control, and more -\u00a0Cons: Lack of steering response at highway speeds and sharper turns, no CNG option available, no turbo petrol motor option, upper variant prices are too diverse.", "author": "By uday", "date": "On: Jan 26, 2023  | 8491 Views"}

Now about the Tiago, according\u00a0to me, mileage is pretty good in the city as well as on the highway. I got 26-28 in the city and 33-35 on the highway which is great for a car, nowadays we buy bikes that give 30-35 kmpl mileage so, mileage is great. Now talking about design it's kind of a decent and very sporty-looking car. Cars front looks great but they can do some more work on the back side a bit more like Altroz which will give it a more edgy look. Now performance, I won't give you much detail about the engine and power figures So,\u00a0 I am coming to the point of the real-world feel this car gives. I can tell there are vibrations and some noise but hey it's a 3-cylinder car what were you expecting,\u00a0Maruti CNG cars have more noise. Performance in both petrol and CNG feels the same you can't differentiate if you are not an automotive nerd(which I am). There is a marginal difference in the power figures but I'll do the job without hesitation. So, In my opinion, if you are going for a CNG vehicle under 10 lakhs you can choose Tata over Maruti and Suzuki. \n", "author": "By vishal tripathi", "date": "On: Jan 25, 2023  | 3502 Views"}

When I say cheap, nothing has been compromised on comfort or safety, that's the stand-out. I have been using it since March 2021. Tata Tiago XZA plus AMT. After driving it for close to 5000 kilometers inside the city and highway, I am writing this review. Pros: 1.Has all features at affordable cost 2. Very comfort. Nobody pain or tiredness for any of the passengers for any kind of travel (shirt in City or long in City or highway ) 3. Eye-catching design and style. Good interiors with 7inch touch screen compatible for android play and apple CSR play. 4. The Harman sound system with 4 speakers and 4 tweeters is a lot and lot better than other rivals (WagonR, Nios i10, grandi10, i20, Ignis, Baleno, swift) 5. Mileage, in City, comes around 14/15. Highway with 120km/hr speed, it comes up to 20. If maintained around 100, it would come up to 23 which tata mentions in the catalog or website. 6. The rear camera, rear wiper, defogger are best. Rain-sensing vapor is good. Auto fold front mirrors are good. The tachometer is sporty. 7. Decent boot space of 240 liters. Fine for a 4 member family. 8. Ground clearance is 170. Again more than its rivals. Comfortable for all speed breakers. 9. Safety, have got 4 \ud83c\udf1f in NCAP rating. Cons: 1. No rear and front parking sensors even in the top model. 2. No trunk light. 3. The trunk when opened using a key, it is very hard to get opened 4.

Pros of this car are its build quality, pricing, and road stability Cons lacks quality in certain plastic parts such as ac vent adjuster, etc which are small issues and engine noise because of 3 cylinder motor. Overall performance is very impressive and I get a mileage of around 20 in the city and 25 on highways. The pick is adequate for a 1050 cc 3 cylinder motor. Tiago has a good interior and has good stability while high speed cruising. Service I had in tata authorized workshop Being servicing in authorized service centers helps in changing parts on time and helps in the long life of the vehicle. Service is so far so good.

(Less knowledge about the car) Pros 1. Best in class infotainment system (Harman music system) 2. Steering response feels good. 3. Good fuel economy only on highways. 4. Driven continuously 2400km (with ac), but no breakdown from engine nor any complaints from the engine side. 5. Ac working well good enough. 7. Feels stable on the highway at 110 to 125 kmph. (As compared to its segment.) 6. Overall a perfect car in its segment. Specially bs6 models. CONS, 1. Engine is very noisy feels like a diesel engine in the petrol engine case no idea how much noise in diesel variant. 2. Engine is very laggy till 2.5k to 3000 rpm. (Especially when ac is on). 3. Cabin noise is too much. 4. Doors, windows glass, dashboard, etc. Always irritate you\u00a0(vibration). 5. Headlights not sufficient in night driving. 6. Completed almost 40000km from September 2018 till Oct 2020. 7. Personally, I'll suggest if ur reading my review till now then probably you\u00a0are thinking of buying tata Tiago, but I'll suggest you\u00a0please have a test drive of ford freestyle or Figo diesel.

The door is too heavy than another Maruti car to build a quality comparison. The build quality is awesome. The most important thing is its music. Its human music gives you\u00a0the best in class. The only cons I found its gear changing the sound. Somehow it lacks on 3rd and 4th gear. And the most common cons is Tata's service. Its service is not too good as compared to others.

Cons: Now coming to the cons I have 2 major and 1 minor con that I feel should be addressed by Tata to make it a perfect car. 1. Hill Performance: On a sunny day you can either have an AC or your car moving those steep hills. I am sure Tata can add a mode or tune it to make it work so that AC doesn't take a big toll on the car power. 2. City Mileage: No matter how good mileage you get on the highway majority of the users are going to drive the car in the city with red lights, random stops, AC on and short trips. Tata needs to improve the city mileage so that you get a respectable 15-16kmpl in city mileage to match it up with Maruti. 3. This is a minor but cup holders for driver and passengers need to be either positioned smartly somewhere else or should be made deep. Any time you have a bottle in there, it simply comes in your way while changing gears.

It is fun to drive on highways 2. Steering feedback is amazing and you'd feel in control as you accelerate and turn through a corner. The car sticks to the road as it speeds up. 3. Pickup is okay-ish, sometimes it takes time to react. The response of the old car(Beat) is better as compared to the new Altroz. 4. Auto-off feature on a traffic signal is useful, but auto-on is difficult to understand (how does it work and why does the car start even before signal opens) 5. New age car features are very useful, particularly being able to make calls using voice command and reverse parking camera. 6. It looks absolutely stunning, particularly it is rear.

{"modelSlug": "altroz", "rating": 5, "title": "Tata Altroz The Gold Standard", "content": "Tata Altroz is the company's first venture in the premium hatchback segment. This is safer and packed with features let's explore this Gold Standard Car. Design; The design of the Tata Altroz doesn't resemble any car till now. The looks are given as a part of 'Impact 2.0' that is the design language followed by Tata Motors. From the front, the position of the fog lamps is seen a little above the regular placement. Even though the car gets projector headlights, they are not LEDs. The tripod stand like grill slots looks appealing. This design is followed somewhere also. From the side, we have certain elements to note. The piano black finish for the ORVMs and the positioning of turn indicators to the body are some of them. The rear door handle also has been moved to the C pillar. The 16-inch alloys look well proportionate to the car. Towards the backside, we can see the blacked taillights. Like I said above the rear end is also distinct with its cutting edges. Getting in is not a task at all. The doors open widely at 90\u00b0 making it even easy for older people. The interior has a floating touch screen infotainment panel surrounded by an ambient light setup. Automatic AC controls below it and certain ports like the USB & AUX ports. The car has a semi-digital instrument cluster. Analog speedometer & digital tachometer and other pieces of information. The seats are supportive and offer good support. They also have a tripod base shaped arrangements on them. Both the front and rear seats have rear armrests. The boot is practical to have luggage for a family trip. You can also flip the back row seats fully to expand the luggage area.\u00a0 Driving and comfort:\u00a0The car is powered by a 1.2-liter revocation petrol engine and a 1.5-liter diesel engine both are BS6 compliant and are mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, no automatic till now but will be released in coming dates. The petrol motor gives 85 hp and 113 nm, it is a three-cylinder engine. But despite being a 3 cylinder mill, the engine is punchy enough to pull the car due to its lightweight This motor is seen in the Nexon also. The diesel motor is a 4 cylinder one seen in the Nexon. But it is detuned to 89hp and 200 nm this is the kingmaker \"the gold standard\" as said by Tata. This is a punchy motor since the torque output is got from a very low RPM, this is peppy enough and enthusiastic to drive. Both these engines have two driving options City & Eco. No sports mode, don't know why Tata avoided it. The mode selector is seen behind the gear lever. This mode changes the theme from blue to green. The top trim also gets cruise control setup. The suspension is good enough but you can feel the comfort when you glide over a pothole. Brilliant work by Tata engineers. Infotainment: The car is packed with Harman's 6 speaker system. The floating touch screen is easy to use compared to previous Tata cars. The sound quality is brilliant and is class-leading. You can customize the theme color as you wish. Variants: Altroz is available from base XE, XM, XT. The car also packs with various options that include factory fitted customizations they are rhythm, Style, Luxe & Urban. These options are available on various levels. Safety: Tata means safety this car scored 5 stars in global NCAP being the second Indian car,\u00a0\u00a0and the first car in its segment to score so. The company packs the car with 2 airbags ABS & EBD as standard.\u00a0 If you want your family to travel in comfort & safe. Then you can choose this car. If you are an enthusiastic driver and all you need is a diesel hatchback then you may go for this car. Because this is the only car in its segment to offer a BS-6 compliant diesel engine. Comparing with competitors: Maruti Baleno, Hyundai Elite i20, Honda Jazz, VW Polo are the main competitors. Comparing with them we see that Altroz is stronger than Baleno and its diesel engine is excellent, but coming to petrol Baleno scores the more. The i20 is the feature-rich car here it also has Hyundai's reliability and offers a 6th gear that its rivals miss. The 1.4litre CRDI diesel and 1.2litre petrol engines are also appreciable. Honda Jazz may be the car with lower specs. But the magic that honda does with its petrol mill is something that none can match with. VW Polo is the synonym of sportiness in this segment its diesel engine having a nice performance too. But taking care of a VW car is a bit tacky. \u00a0The Tata Altroz is a car that a common man can buy it is sufficiently powerful (diesel motor), and the best in safety. It also offers segment-first features like floating screen & ambient lighting.", "author": "By agnel ajay", "date": "On: Feb 04, 2020  | 850 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "Tata_New_Safari", "rating": 3, "title": "Dealing With Tata Not Worth It", "content": "I have now been an owner of the Tata Safari XZA for two weeks now, and have driven it for 2000 KMs, in the city, and the mountains. Here is my impression from this period. First, the terrible - The car shut down when driving to Rohtang, and could not make the climb. This was barely a few KMS away from Manali, just when the roads start to get steep. I have made this drive several times in the past, with a Hyundai i20 and a Maruti Ciaz, and neither had any issues making it to the pass. It looked like the engine was over-heated, but the temperature gauges read normal. We were unable to get this issue diagnosed and fixed when back in Delhi. The Tata service center was unable to find anything wrong with the car. We haven't experienced this again. Next, the bad - 1. The tech in the car is really bad. It's not just sub-par quality like the reviews make it seem, it's a pain. - The car does not seem to recognise the presence of the key in it's viscinity very well, and about 5-8 times in the last two weeks, we've ended up with it blaring it's alarms, and an error message saying the key was too far away. (The key was right there obviously - a quick start and stop using the ignition button fixes this issue) - We have had a lot of issue with getting Apple Car Play working. Sometimes it just won't recognise the phone connected to it regardless of the number of times you re-plug it, and a restart of the car is all that will fix it. - The rear view camera is god awful. The resolution is absolutely terrible, and is basically useless. The only bit about the park/reverse assistance that helps is the audio alert for proximity. I am very used to the excellent rear view camera on the Maruti Ciaz that gave me a lot of confidence - this doesn't. The other disappointing experience about this purchase was the delivery and post-delivery experience. I had some inkling of this, since poor reviews of Tata Service Centres and the showroom are not uncommon online. However, I did not expect it to be as bad as it was. The staff was generally uncaring, and it needed several follow ups for each step in the delivery process (from booking to the day we actually collected the car) for things to be done. Even now, we continue to painfully follow up on the registration, activation of the Tata iRA app, investigation on the over-heating issue we faced, etc. Since we were already over 2000KMs, we also experienced the first free service, which was also sub-par and disappointing. I will not go into the details of it, but everyone can do without the stress of dealing with Tata staff. The car does have qualities that makes it an attractive purchase, but with the problems I shared above, I do wish I could go back and choose a different, more reliable brand instead. ( Thinking Hyundai, Kia, etc ) The launch of the Mahindra XUV700 recently makes me feel especially bad, since it looks like they've done a much better job of the tech implementation in the car.", "author": "By navid khan", "date": "On: Sep 01, 2021  | 700 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "tigor", "rating": 2.5, "title": "It Looks Premium But Gives Poor Drive Quality Exp.", "content": "Tata Tigor XZ+ (top-end) manual variant. My honest feedback: Pros: 1) Stylish exterior design. Lots of Chromes used in exterior as well as in Interior and with Diamond cut Alloy Wheel, we will get a Premium Sedan to look and feel. 2) Very spacious, lot of Legroom and comfort 3) Good Infotainment System Cons: 1. Very poor pick-up. We need to press the Accelerator so much to achieve even a 40 km/hr speed, so we can't expect a good Drive quality. 2. Poor Noise insulation. When compared to other brands like Maruti, Hyundai, the noise level inside the Cabin at a normal speed is too much. 3. Poor audio system. The Harman audio system quality just not up-to mark.\u00a0I feel erratic when I play the same USB drive which I use in my other Car 4. The rear camera quality is so bad (it looks blurred) and there is no Sensor for reverse parking 5. No rear a/c\u00a0and just one Light at the center for the entire Cabin. 6. Poor Boot cover design. There is a sharp edge in the boot cover which is really dangerous, it is highly possible to hit anyone's forehead very sharply and cause serious injury. Overall verdict: Not a great product and not advisable to buy; perhaps Altroz could be a better product than Tigor (not sure about it as I didn't check it). My opinion is, Instead of spending 8 Lakhs on Tigor, there are a lot of good Hatchback Car options available from various brands in the market which we can consider buying.

Everyone has their priority aspects while purchasing the car but mine was in the order of safety, comfort, price, mileage, and features. It has bagged 4 stars in NCAP for safety, it's suspension is very good as compared to the other cars in this segment, price is competitive, mileage it gives 20 km (combined) in eco mode. It has the required features. I have driven in the city and went on long drives about 600kms. I feel confident and safe while driving. It never gave me any problem until now. Coming to the cons the styling is not very much impressive and it's a personal choice. While putting the reverse gear I need to apply slightly more force than the forward gears but for me, it's ignorable since it's very slight and if I don't apply then it will be stuck in between. Car-related apps are not useful. Just for namesake, they are lying in Android store. People say Tata service centers are not good but I suggest to enquire and go to a good service center. And, also you need to deal with the people who disesteem you for owning a TATA :), just be happy with your decision and ignore those people, also keep in mind every car has some cons be it a supercar or budget car.", "author": "By shukur", "date": "On: Jul 20, 2020  | 14081 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "tigor", "rating": 5, "title": "The Styleback Reloaded...", "content": "Tata Togor is the company's venture to the segment that they have started 'The sub-4-meter sedans'. Tigor is the sedan model of the Tiago. This measures under 4meters to cut the tax duties. Now Tata has upgraded the Tigor to BS 6 and to a new styling \u00d7Design Tigor is now based on impact 2.0 design language. The tripod base shaped arrow design os seen all-over the car on the grills to the seats. From the front, the car looks somewhat like the Tata Altroz. The projector headlights are alike and the hexagonal shaped fog lamps are fitted inside a black insert. A chromium line runs below the grill and a redesigned air dam below the grill. The side remains unchanged the length is similar to the older one. The diamond-cut alloys are 15 inches. The backside now has a LED tail lamp and a reverse parking camera. The main highlight is the LED rear-mounted brake lamp. The boot remains the same 419 liters.\u00a0The Interior remains more or less the same. Except for the Tata Altroz sourced flat-bottom steering wheel which has controls for the infotainment zone and a 7-inch touch screen system. This system has 4 speakers and 2 tweeters from Harman Kardon. The music experience is awesome in this segment. The rear seat is sofa-like. Sitting 3 occupants is a breeze. The seat offers an armrest from the base XE variant. The car lacks rear AC vents that are seen on its competitors. But the air throw is strong enough to cool the cabin easily. \u00d7Drving& Comfort The Tata Tigor is sourced by a 1.2 liter 4 cylinder revolution petrol mill. No diesel option is available. This 1.2-liter engine is now BS6 compliant and offers 86hp and 114nm which is decent compared to its rivals. This being a 3 cylinder engine may have vibrations and harshness. But Tata has done a good job in noise insulation. Technically the engine is the same unit on the tiago. But the gear ratios are different. The engine can pull the car with ease. Like the other Tata cars, this car also has driving modes. This engine is offered on 5-speed manual and amt gearboxes. Cruise control is missing in this car. The suspension is nice and does its job very well. The car does have a rear center armrest and also the seats are wide enough to have 3 occupants. The company says this as sofa seating. The central tunnel is not so large so that 3 occupants can sit easily. But the car can have rear AC vents. But the AC unit is capable to cool the cabin sooner. \u00d7Variants Tigor is available in XE,XM,XT,XZ& XZ+ variants. There are also AMT variants available on XM& XZ+ variants. Prices start from 5.75 lakhs for the base XE to 7.5 lakhs for the top-spec XZ+AMT variant. \u00d7Infotainment The car has a 7inch touch screen system from Harman. It delivers the best sound quality in its segment. This system has apple car play and android auto connectivity. This screen also shows up as the display for reverse camera \u00d7Safety The car is occupied with 2 airbags ABS& EBD as standard. The car also scored 4 stars in the Global NCAP test. \u00d7For Whom Is This Car is for those who need a stylish sub-4-meter sedan and offers better safety at this price. \u00d7Updates The car offers an electrically folding ORVM in the top model. Also, the rear armrest is now standard fitment. ABS, EBD& 2 airbags are also standard now. But the rear AC vents are not provided in this update also. \u00d7Comparison with the competitors The main competition of Tigor is with the Maruti Dzire, Honda Amaze& the newly launched Hyundai Aura. Among this, the Tigor only has a petrol engine other diesel option too. The features are more or less the same except the connectivity features of the Aura. Also, the Tigor only has a 3 cylinder engine compared to the 4 cylinder engines of others. \u00d7Verdict If you need a car that runs in petrol and is BS6 compliant and needs a much better cabin experience, a safer car, and a nice rear seat, you can go for Tigor.", "author": "By agnel ajay", "date": "On: Feb 28, 2020  | 164 Views"}

I can say that it's been a complete family car for me as of now. I had Maruti Alto before this, but when I bought Wagon R, almost all the issues, which I used to face with Maruti Alto have been solved. The biggest problem I used to face as a 6 feet tall guy with my Alto was that the head and legroom were not that good. However, when I have driven Wagon R while taking a test drive, I felt an ample amount of space and I didn't feel cozy while driving it. It was so comfortable and smooth. Wagon R also offers a good boot space, I can easily carry three big-size trolly bags in it without any issue. New Wagon R not only offers comfort, but it also comes with a lot of features like power steering, power window, ABS, Driver and passenger airbags, multi-functional steering wheel, It also offers a heater along with an air conditioner. There are things I think could have been better the mileage, the plastic quality could have been better, and the adjustable driver's seat and rear parking camera could have been a great addition. Considering the price Wagon R is a complete family car, and the new stylish look might attract the young generation as well.", "author": "By abhishek bishnoi", "date": "On: Aug 15, 2022  | 2294 Views"}

Design - An eye-catching boxy look, kind of mini wrangler. 2. 18inch allow wheels with better ground clearance. I am expecting to change the lane by driving over the road dividers in case the U-turn is more than 1km. 3. As the city streets are no different than off-road streets these days with millions of potholes here and there, Thar serves the purpose of my daily off-roading dreams. 4. Good for a small family or use it as a second car. Cons: 1. Overpriced: Either M&M didn't conduct price sensitivity testing among the potential buyers to identify the right pricing model, or they assumed that they are going to sell limited units, so why not at a premium cost. Those who wanna buy will buy anyhow. 2. M&M isn't aware of the new segment apart from those who buy Thar for off-road only - Regular office goers who want to use Thar as their daily car or a second car for a family outing during the weekends. 3. So many loose wires here such as the glass defrost at the back 4. There is no boot space officially. Even Tata Nano had better boot space Conclusions: 1. Eventually, the buyers would curse Thar designers when they are over with the looks of Thar and start facing real issues 2. Bring down the cost of LX MT 4 seater to 12 lakh on-road.

One of the greatest demerits which I found is ingress and egress in the rear seat, as there is no door option. You have to fold the front row, which is in my opinion is far more difficult. The rear seat can seat only two. On the other hand for little offroading, Nexon, Venue, Ecosport, Brezza are good options. Even Bolero is a more practical car than Thar. So guys, paying 11 to 15 lacks for this touch machine is a big deal. In this price range, Kia is offering good cars. Even Harrier, Scorpio, or Creta could be great in 15 lacks.

I would have gone for this car if they had provided the split rare seat but for now its a not a good buy for 7 seater car.", "author": "By shahin", "date": "On: Jul 28, 2022  | 1619 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "My Experience  (W8) Petrol", "content": "Hello, I am here to share my experience after ~2 years and ~20 thousand KM of usage. This might help the prospective buyers to shortlist this Indian brand and the model. In my opinion, this is the best car and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking to own one in this segment. Let me be very clear, I am not an Auto expert or I am not comparing it with any of its peers. I am just sharing my experience in the past couple of years as a normal user. Few points to mention: This is a spacious car with a lot of legroom and it has got a lot of storage options. Very comfortable to drive both in the city and the highways, cruise control works seamlessly, wider tires give better grip and comfort in the worst roads. Very powerful engine (notably there is a Turbo lag, but it doesn't matter as I am not using this for any dirt race. The engine is thirsty for fuel for sure as most of the reviews you might have seen this, lemme give few facts which I have noted down and this might change your perspective about this. The method used to calculate mileage: Full tank to Full tank (fill full tank fuel, drive from location A to B, again fill the fuel full tank, KM's covered divided by the number of liters consumed is the actual mileage) 1. Stingy Mode: (A/C off, Windows open, normal load, road condition required gear shift between 2nd to 5th, max speed 75 km/h): Result was unbelievable, it has given move than 18 km/l mileage. ( This is not very practical though). 2. Long Drive: (A/C always on, all types of roads(Best to worst you can think of..), gear shifts 4th to 6th most of the time, max speed): Result: approx 15 km/l. 3. City Mode: (A/C always on, heavy to moderate traffic): Result: Approx 10-12 km/l. 4. Sports Mode: (A/C always on, heavy acceleration, max speed): Result: 12-13 km/l. I hope this gives you a fair idea of how the engine behaves with your driving conditions. This certainly does justice, For those who are looking for the best mileage in this segment please stay away from this, if you wanna enjoy your driving please go for it. I will not talk about safety features, CZ I will go with NCAP rating which is already 5 star. I will not talk about a lot of other features IOT etc.. which other brands provide, CZ practically those are of no much use for me. Yes, boot space is less, but it's sufficient for a micro family. Finally the price, I feel it's at par with other brands, yes I too feel it's a little expensive but trust me it does justice for its value. After-sales service is so far so well didn't face any issue till now. To conclude: If you are a light-footed user then you can expect 14-15 km/l mileage from this, in high speed also the vehicle is very stable and very little cabin noise. This is definitely fun to drive vehicle.", "author": "By mithun shetty", "date": "On: Apr 18, 2021  | 71469 Views"}

Drive dynamics are awesome. Comfortable to drive with a Commanding view. You can definitely feel its high power and torque which you will love to revv. It gives good Mileage on highways as long as your speed is 100 or less and also depends on your driving. Maximum mileage I have got is 25.9. I have achieved average of 20 or more on many occasions. Average mileage : 16 (City) & 20 (Highway). Top speed of mine: 161 kms. I haven't dared to go beyond that speed nor I have found a good road to do so. But trust me it has got enough grunt to go above 180 kms. Best Feature: You can check your last 6 journeys including the current one like what was your average/economy, Top Speed, Starting and ending location, Distance in kms, how many times you have tapped brakes and clutch per km and you can also check your driving score like how well you are driving. Its a fantastic feature which I like the most. On highways you will feel its ride is a lot Promising like it is Stable even at higher speeds and Secure as the weight of this beast (Gross Weight 1400kgs approx) is a lot heavier than other vehicles in the competition, build quality is great, it has got all 4 disc brakes and 7 air bags. Cons: Turning radius is more so tight parking is slightly difficult. From the side view, it looks slightly dis-proportionate. Rear Ac vent is missing. But AC is powerful and front vents supply enough AC to the rear seats. Overall I am happy with my little beast.

Dual Climate control for driver and co-driver which I think is a mind-blowing hi-tech feature you can\u00a0say. All-wheel disc brakes, this is also an excellent feature of this vehicle. I think the driving of this diesel variant will be as same as Mahindra Marazzo because this vehicle is equipped with the same engine, hence emits the same torque. This vehicle also has steering modes like comfort, sport and normal.", "author": "By tuneer ", "date": "On: Dec 05, 2019  | 5557 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 4, "title": "Best Car In The Market", "content": "The odometer reads a ton after a month I have brought Mahindra XUV300 in the top-spec trim to my home. There are some things I\u00a0am\u00a0still getting used to.so,here is my review on my new Mahindra XUV300-diesel manual: Design: the Mahindra XUV300 is a good looking car,\u00a0raised up bonnet line, the grill that is taken up from the bigger Mahindra XUV500 does give it an appealing look to this car .moving on to the side you will realize this compact SUV looks muscular and stands prominent on 17 inch wheels. The rear end is really where the car looks attractive. The LED combination taillights and that blackout plastic bumper seems like well put together .overall the design will grab some eyeballs for sure. Interiors: The Mahindra XUV300 gets leatherette seats and some bits like the aircon vents seems like a piece of art. There are some hard plastics on top of the dash that feel too cheap. Also, some switch gears that feel a bit dated in the modern SUV. The Mahindra XUV300 is a spacious car(long wheelbase in this segment) but the rear seat occupants do not get any aircon vents and charging ports. The real drawback lies in the boot it is 256 liters and it's only up to small hatchback levels. Tech and safety: The Mahindra XUV300 is feature-loaded SUV. The 7-inch touch screen is sleek to use and has inbuilt navigation and apple car play and android auto. The bigger units on the ecosport and the venue have some more tech and feel fluid to use. The features that are first to the segment are Heated ORVM and a dual-zone climate control system. Safety now being the priority across Indian car buyers and for one the Mahindra XUV300 brings it. The safety feature that the Mahindra XUV300 gets are:7 airbags,all-wheel disc brakes, ABS, ESP, EBD, hill start assist. The features like 7 airbags and all-wheel disc brakes are first to the segment. Driving and handling: The xuv300 is powered by 1.5L turbocharged diesel and a 1.2L turbocharged petrol engines. The model which I own is the 1.5L turbo diesel and which is made to a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine has no lag lower down. The mid-range is where the car really shines the mid-range is very punchy and I feel like the maximum power and torque lies there(115hp and 300NM). The top-end do not have the punch that is felt in the mid-range but it doesn't feel bad. Overall the engine is good until and unless you need every horse from the motor. The steering is good so feels connected and accurate all tough the steering modes doesn't alter many things. The car rides better even on the worst of roads. Thanks to the fact that the car rides on wider section wheels. Body roll is well contained. The motor is not very refined in idle but when you start driving it doesn't get vocal. The mileage is not well in both conditions it could barely give out only 12-20kmpl. Should you buy one: My reply would be yes, the service is good, there are no major issues till now. The price may seem on the high side but what you get for your money is a good family car.", "author": "By loganathan", "date": "On: Sep 30, 2019  | 6683 Views"}

Traction control, EBD, ABS, ESP and many more technical features for stable and steady driving 8. Dual Air Bag, Dual Climate control, Air conditioning very good and whole cabin 9. The music system is Good if you hear in midrange volume its very good in bass and treble, it only becomes bad in bass once you play it in full sound. 10. Rear view camera and sensors help a lot while parking and reversing. 11.

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 4, "title": "Best car", "content": "Pros - 1. Engine delivers tremendous performance with awesome power and torque with minimal turbo lag. 2. Suspensions- very well balanced for potholes as well as highways. 3. Space- very much spacious along with comfortable seats. 4. Safe - good build quality, heavy and rigid structure (you can feel it by using it once only), 7 airbags. 5. Features - feature loaded with the balance between convenient features like dual-zone ac and heated outside mirrors along with performance features like steering control. 6. Looks - well this depends on person to person whether design impresses one or not but one thing is sure it has road presence and it's very hard to ignore. Cons - 1. Boot space is an issue if someone travels with a lot of luggage along with many passengers. 2. Rear ac vents are surely a major miss. 3. Mileage is less compare to competitors, I managed to the cartilage of 16-17 after the first service. (diesel). 4. Variants are not well priced so only value for money variants are either the top one or the bottom one i.e w8 opt and w4 respectively. 5. Other features like telescopic steering, cornering fog lights are missing. And also I think sound quality could have been better at least for the top variant but yeah it's same as other in the segments except Tata Nexa. Conclusion - by reading the above pros and cons anyone can say that it's a great value for money vehicles as it delivers class-leading performance along with the class-leading features. In fact, it could compete with some cars above its segment. For me the best part of the car is it's driving performance since after so long something came up which can give a tough competition to ford engines, else there is no point in comparing its performance with other ones like Tata and Hyundai in this segment. Note- all points are mentioned as a review of xuv300 w8 optional diesel variant costing near about 13.3 lakhs.", "author": "By anonymous", "date": "On: Aug 22, 2019  | 76 Views"}

Just aim with the steering and throttle it and it will do exactly what you want to. Ride comfort can actually beat VW SUVs, Jeep Compass, Toyota, anything. It's that comfy.

The car is wide enough to be providing a great stable ride with much-awaited confidence in the corners. However, if u feel like going out for a family vacation, I'm afraid that's going to be a problem. This is mainly because you can carry 5 passengers only but more importantly, the boot\u00a0size of the\u00a0hatchback. Literally, the boot is just 1L more than that of a Grand i10 which is surprising as it's not even close to being an SUV. Certainly, it now feels like the sub4-meter was an afterthought by Mahindra. However, if you like driving your own car yourself it's a total surprise as it has the best torque in its segment. Its 40Nm is more than Creta which is a much heavier an bigger car. So driving is a great pleasure in this Mahindra but practicality is on the very extreme end. Overall, 3 stars from my side.", "author": "By aditya sinha", "date": "On: Apr 13, 2019  | 181 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "The Mahindra XUV 300", "content": "The XUV 300 is the third sub-four-meter SUV of Mahindra. Mahindra has partnered with Ssangyong to bring its 3rd car. The Mahindra XUV 300 is basically the Ssangyong Tivoli with a significant facelift. The XUV 300 is a cheetah inspired design with the outer edges of the headlamps flow down to the fog lamps. It gets a 17- inch alloy which looks quite aggressive with the sharp cuts and black finish. The tail lamps are stylish and the windscreen is topped by a spoiler. It also gets a stylish skid plate. In the interiors, the XUV 300 looks more like the Tivoli. It gets a 7- inch touchscreen with Android auto and apple car play, ventilated glow box, cruise control, sunroof, heated outside mirrors, a twin-pod instrumental cluster, dual zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, auto lamps and wipers. As for safety features, it comes with 7 airbags, ABS, ESP, Isofix mounts and hill-start assist. The XUV 300 gets turbocharged 1.2-liter petrol and a 1.5-liter diesel both with 6-speed manual gearbox. Vibrations are absent but noise levels are slightly on the higher side. The engine doesn't have adjustable drive modes but the steering has adjustable modes. At Rs 7.9 lakh to Rs 11.44 lakh for petrol and Rs 8.49 lakh to Rs 11.99 lakh for diesel, the XUV 300 gives a very high competition to its competitors. Overall the ride quality is really good. The pricing makes it more practical and is better than most of its competitors.", "author": "By rajkumar", "date": "On: Mar 30, 2019  | 38 Views"}

New Cars The fact that the XUV300 is based on the same platform as the SsangYong Tivoli is well known. And if you didn't\u00a0already know, well, you do now. But while its Korean sibling has a body that stretches to 4.2 meters, Mahindra's offering is 3.99m long. Of course, Mahindra had to economize in terms of size to squeeze the XUV300 under the 4m mark. You see, the bumpers have been chopped on both ends, leaving the rear end looking a bit slab-sided. The good thing, however, is that the chassis hasn't been touched. The wheelbase is 2,600mm, same as the Tivoli ? which makes it the longest amongst its direct rivals. In fact, it?s 10mm longer than even the Hyundai Creta. The XUV300 is also the widest in the segment, at 1.82m. However, at 1.62m in height, it?s slightly dwarfed by both the Brezza and the EcoSport.", "author": "By sanchit gupta", "date": "On: Mar 30, 2019  | 138 Views"}

It has many safety features like ABS, 7 Airbags & ESP, it has electric heated OVRMs. The car is too spacious even three medium built people can easily sit in the back seat. One feature I like most in this car is its Hybrid function. While you drive the car and if you stop on the red light as soon as you remove your foot from clutch its engine stops, and when you press the clutch, the car automatically starts. Its torque is also best in class. Further, this car is giving a mileage of 14. However the company claims 17, but let's see after the first service may be it\u00a0increases. Further., Mahindra has put the best music system and 7\" infotainment system and reverse camera with parking assist system and mood changing cluster display which is also good.

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 4, "title": "Needs Design Correction For Excellent Vehicle", "content": "The driving experience has been very good but needs some design corrections, which will make it one of the best. The placement of Right rear view mirror along with windshield Pillar obstructs view while turning right. The leg space for the driver is cramped. The interiors are very good except for the boot space. I purchased Mahindra XUV300 W8(o), after waiting for it for almost a month and the buying experience has been good, though with no surprises as I could get no discounts from the dealer, but got good fast paperwork at MGB Mobile, Anantapur, in Andhra Pradesh. The accessories cost you a bomb and fixing them too took a very long time spoiling the enthusiasm of driving out a new vehicle. I am writing this review after the first mandatory vehicle service and driving 2,000 KM in the past 25 days since I am owning it. Looks wise it is stunning and the aquamarine color is quite attractive. It is my fourth car in 20 years, I looked forward to some driving comfort, good safety features. I am fully satisfied with the passenger space, though the boot space has been compromised for that. Also if you are migrating from a Sedan like Honda Amaze you will feel the pinch. Now coming to the driving comfort, three modes of steering wheel makes very little difference. Driving on the highways is a sheer pleasure. Even at 140 KMPH the vehicle is stable and you do not feel the speed or no vibration is transferred into the cabin. The leg space for the driver is very cramped, which should have been definitely wider for a comfortable seating and longer driving experience. You have very little scope to spread your legs or keep knees apart. You will be forced to keep your left leg on the clutch pedal or inconveniently below it. Now coming to the design, the worst experience for the driver is while turning to right - into a lane -- where you cannot see anything as the visibility is totally blocked by the large Rear View Mirror (due to its positioning) and very close to that is the front Pillar holding the windshield. These two together totally block your view. For a seasoned driver, it is Ok, but for a new driver, it could be a cause of concern. THE MAHINDRA XUV300 DESIGN TEAM needs to look into this aspect. The 185 mm ground clearance is worthwhile and larger wheelbase does provide it the stability. The infotainment is enjoyable as its quality is good. Some smaller features I am myself yet to get used to as some of them are complicated. Number of KMs to empty tank showed -that changes dynamically depending on the traffic and driving conditions, is very useful on highways. Ecosense is a good feature. -- RAMESH SUSARLA", "author": "By ramesh susarla", "date": "On: Mar 25, 2019  | 51 Views"}

But let's keep comparing aside and come to the point, where XUV really shines is in its features and looks, the features list is massive from infotainment features like apple car play android auto to small details like the color change of the instrument cluster. The quality of materials used inside the cabin is good but not what you expect from such a car and the climate control switches is the place where you really see this thing. For the Rear passengers, there are no rear AC vents so they have to rely on the front ones which in our conditions is so not reliable. About the drive of the car, the engines are powerful and the turbo petrol engine is really a drivers engine which you would definitely enjoy driving. The pricing of the XUV is a bit high as again compared to its competition but what it offers apart from the competition are the features and the looks and that massive road presence.", "author": "By gaurav vadnere", "date": "On: Mar 24, 2019  | 50 Views"}

The XUV300 has a mature design for the most part. The most striking feature up front is the LED light signature. These DRLs rise up to the headlamps which too have a nice upward sweep and merge cleanly with the slim grille. The chrome studs here are a direct connection to its bigger cousin. The larger air dam below and the contours on the bonnet add a dose of the requisite SUV aggression. The flat floating roof stops the car from looking top-heavy. Move below and two creases break the profile's monotony. The wheels themselves on this top-spec W8 Option car are 215/55 R17s and fill up the wheel arches wells. But the crease at the rear bulges and grows into a wide U through the boot lid, making the rear three-quarter look awkward. The truncated rear, a necessity to duck the car under four meters, and the high boot opening intensify this feeling. The rear tail lamps also could have been a size smaller but the design itself is smart, with their flowing LED elements.", "author": "By suhas kadam", "date": "On: Mar 06, 2019  | 33 Views"}

But, there was a little vibration that I felt on a diesel car and there is a little bit of lag below 2000rpm because of which city drive become little busy but with the petrol engine, there is no such issue. It cleanly pulls off very good for the city as well as highway drive. Price wise it still is on the higher side but if you want to buy this car and your budget is tight. One more thing in petrol version your service is done in every 10000 km or one year whichever is first but in diesel its 20000 km. The\u00a0cost of service will be approx 21 paise per km for diesel version and 26 paise for petrol one and one more thing the price difference between petrol and diesel is around 48k to 52k again depending on your city.

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "Mahindra XUV300", "content": "The most awaited compact SUV of 2019 is finally out. Mahindra has launched the XUV300 at the competitive price of Rs\u00a07.79 lakhs. In the midst of the growing excitement, there has been a buzz around what's new it offers in the segment where cars such as Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport and Tata Nexon are vying against each other. I was just going through the official launch coverage and found this car absolutely amazing in several areas. The XUV is unique in many ways. Starting with the exteriors, the car gets segment first features such as all-around disc brakes with the longest wheelbase and largest width in the class. In terms of interiors and safety equipment, the first in class features include dual-zone automatic climate control, front parking sensors, sunroof, 7-inch touchscreen infotainment and 7 airbags. The safety net of 7 airbags is absolutely a brilliant move since buyers are increasingly becoming aware of safety nowadays. Besides segment-first features, we get Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity with the infotainment and also heated wing mirrors. The top end variant has been well kitted with safety features such as hill hold assist, front and rear fog lamps, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child mount anchorage. Moreover, there isn't a dearth of comfort factors as it gets leatherette seats, push engine start/stop button, reverse camera, automatic headlamps and rain sensing wipers, power folding and adjustable ORVMs, cruise control and soft touch dashboard among others. In terms of mechanicals, it compares with the rivals as the petrol engine produces 110hp in both Nexon and XUV300. However, when it comes to diesel powertrain, first it comes with first in class mild-hybrid setup and secondly, it produces 117hp which is 7hp more than Nexon and 27hp more than Vitara Brezza. So, clearly in the diesel department, the XUV300 seems to be a clear winner. However, there isn't any automatic transmission option available neither with the petrol nor with the diesel engine, so it would be a disadvantage as of now. But Mahindra has promised it will bring AMT transmission in coming months. Overall, with the staggering booking of 4000 units before launch, we can say this car will going to play a crucial role in the segment.", "author": "By himanshu", "date": "On: Feb 14, 2019  | 226 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "Mahindra XUV300  Exceptional!", "content": "As we all know, that compact SUVs in India is a common sight. Many car makers have already tasted the success of their products in the country and many are coming forward with the same. Without any doubt, it is one of the fastest growing car segments currently in the country. Mahindra already has already KUV100 in their product portfolio but the company could not get much foothold in the compact SUV segment till date. So, Mahindra is coming up with the all-new XUV300. It does have the potential to change the game for Mahindra in the already crowded compact SUV segment in India. The compact SUV will give tough competition to the like in the segment such as Maruti Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport, Tata Nexon and Honda WR-V. If we talk about the car, on the outside, Mahindra XUV300 is based on Ssangyong's Tivoli and shares the basic stance with the same. But it has some differences as the overall length has been shortened by 200mm. Now it measures about 3995mm in length, 1820mm in width, 1620mm in height and has the wheelbase of 2620mm. The face looks fresh and aggressive. The slim radiator grille is highlighted by the LED projector headlamps and DRLs provide it with sophisticated looks. Fog lamps get black housing. On the sides, character lines above the wheels arches add masculine looks to the SUV. The car wears 17-inch tyres but we would love to see 18-inch tyres because it looks quite small. At the back, the chunky looking thick C-pillar adds to the overall looks of XUV300. Other elements are a smart looking tail lamp, integrated spoiler and contrast roof that looks good. Stepping inside, Mahindra XUV300's cabin is a nice place to be in. All the upholstery is done in white leatherette material while the dashboard is black. The material used and the fit and finish inside is good. In terms of features, Mahindra is loaded to the gills. The vehicle gets a 7-inch infotainment system that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It also features dual-zone climate control, tyre pressure monitoring system, navigation, multi-colour instrument cluster, sunroof and heated ORVMs. Safety features are ABS with EBD, 7 airbags, ISOFIX mounts, roll-over mitigation, traction control, hill-start assist, brake fade compensation and more. Powertrains include a 1.2L petrol engine and 1.5L diesel oil burner. Summing it up, in my opinion, Mahindra XUV300 is a quality product with a long feature list and attractive design. It will for sure appeal the masses.", "author": "By nakul", "date": "On: Feb 11, 2019  | 79 Views"}

Mahindra just like other automakers is going crazy after compact SUVs. It is the fourth compact SUV after Quanto, NuvoSport and the TUV300 NXT. And man, look at the styling, it?s absolutely brilliant and seems to be a giving Maruti Vitara Brezza a run for its money. The car is based on Mahindra?s Korean subsidiary Ssangyong Tivoli but the carmaker has changed a number of things to suit the Indian conditions. And the end result is more stylish and rugged SUV that looks more gorgeous than its Korean counterpart. Besides, diamond cut alloy wheels, full LED projector headlamps and LED tail lamps, the cabin is also contemporary with some segment first features. The new XUV300 will be offered with large 8-inch touchscreen infotainment unit compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, USB and Bluetooth. The will also feature dual-zone climate control, auto engine start/stop, reverse parking as well as the sunroof. The dual tone interiors as per images revealed by Mahindra are well finished while the dashboard is well laid out. The instrument cluster also seems to be notches above the current Mahindra cars. But the most striking thing about this car is the 1.5L diesel engine which is shared from the Marazzo MPV. The engine makes 123PS which is 33PS more than what Vitara Brezza offers. This is something which will decide the fate of this car.

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "Mahindra XUV300  Stylish Mini SUV", "content": "Mahindra & Mahindra is all set up to bring up a new car in the market, the fresh XUV300. The car is perfect for the young enthusiast and prospective buyers and can be used as the perfect family car. As we all know that compact SUVs these days are much preferred over any other segment. So, in order to grab that large chunk of sale, Mahindra brought up with the new concept in the already adored space. The official launch of XUV300 will be in mid-February 2019, till now we have plenty of details about the car and that seems impressive. New Mahindra XUV300 is, of course, one of the most awaited launches of 2019. The new XUV300 is based on the Ssangyong Tivoli and is positioned below the most successful XUV500 in the line-up. The car will give tough competition to the likes in the segment that includes Maruti Brezza, Honda WR-V, and Tata Nexon. The forthcoming SUV is built on the monocoque construction as seen in its Korean subsidiary SsangYong. The popular Tivoli?s X100 architecture is used to create the power packed and efficient XUV300. So, Mahindra XUV300 is the fourth sub-four-meter SUV and the first one to sit on the advanced monocoque construction. In simple words, XUV300 is the modern SUV ever coming from the Mahindra?s stable. On the outside, XUV300 takes some of the design cues from XUV500. Such as headlamp design and tear duct lines. It's squared of a bonnet and shoulder line goes well with the LED DRLs and chrome finished radiator grille. The car gets flared wheel arches as seen in Tivoli. At the back, it gets the complete new looks with LED tail lights which look modern European design. Inside the cabin too, it gets inspiration from the Tivoli. The center console gets integrated touchscreen infotainment unit. The XUV300 gets dual tone color scheme and high gloss black and aluminum silver elements all around. The car comes packed with advanced features and creature comforts. As far as the safety is concerned, XUV300 will come equipped with seven-airbags, ABS, EBD, and Electronic Stability Program. Under the hood, it is expected to get the same powertrain that does its duty in Marazzo. The 1.5L diesel engine can churn 121bhp and yields the maximum torque of 300Nm. It's another mill is 1.2L turbocharged petrol, both the engines are expected to be offered in manual gearbox at the time of launch and automatic transmission will be offered later. As for the pricing, Mahindra is expected to keep the prices competitive with the aim to gain a sizable amount of share in the market. On paper and with few images surfaced on the internet, it seems Mahindra has finally got the right weapon in the compact SUV segment as TUV300 hasn?t returned many benefits till date. All fingers crossed.", "author": "By shailesh", "date": "On: Jan 02, 2019  | 80 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "xuv300", "rating": 5, "title": "Best car in the segment", "content": "Mahindra's codename SUV, the S201 has been officially named the XUV300. Based on the Ssangyong Tivoli, the XUV300 will be positioned below the XUV500 in Mahindra's stable and will compete against the likes of the Maruti Brezza, Tata Nexon as well as the Honda WR-V. It is expected to be launched in February 2019. The design of the XUV300 takes its cues from the bigger XUV500 in terms of headlamp design and the characteristic tear duct lines. The squared-off bonnet and shoulder line is complemented with Mahindra?s chrome-finished grille and LED daytime running light. Similar to the Tivoli, the XUV300 gets a flared wheel arches design but at the rear, the tail lights are completely new. Compared to the wrap around design seen on the Tivoli, the XUV300 gets an LED tail lights which look modern and gets a very European design. The five-spoke 17-inch designer wheels gels well with the overall stance of the XUV300. The cabin of Baby XUV is inspired directly from the Tivoli with a hint of Mahindra's elements at all the right places. The upright center console gets an integrated touchscreen infotainment system. The upright stance of the XUV300 gives a commanding seating position to the XUV300, claims Mahindra. The dual-tone cabin gets high-gloss black and aluminium silver elements all around. Besides the usual list of creature comforts, the XUV300 will be loaded with segment-first features. The top-spec variant will get seven airbags, sunroof, dual-zone climate control and disc brakes for all four wheels. Under the hood, the XUV300 will be offered with both petrol and diesel drivetrain options. We expect the same 1.5-litre turbodiesel engine from the Marazzo which produces 121bhp/300Nm to be joined by a 1.2-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine. Both the petrol and diesel engines of the Mahindra S201 are expected to offer a manual at the time of launch. But we expect an automatic transmission option to be offered at a later date. When launched in February next year, the XUV300 will be positioned between the XUV500 and a TUV300. Mahindra is expected to keep the prices competitive with an aim to gain a sizeable amount of market share in the ever-growing compact SUV segment. The price tag is expected to be around Rs 8-12 lakhs (ex-showroom).", "author": "By subhash chand", "date": "On: Dec 20, 2018  | 91 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "sonet", "rating": 4.5, "title": "Stylish Outstanding Nifty Energetic And Trendy SUV", "content": "The Kia Sonet is one of the most stylish and well-rounded compact SUVs in the market among the sea of compact SUVs available in the market right now. After experiencing every other compact SUV in the market, the Kia Sonet was the one that struck my heart the most. Its fun and frugal diesel engine with a smooth 6-speed torque converter AT gearbox sealed the deal for me. The only diesel AT with a proper 'auto' box in the segment, the Kia Sonet diesel AT is definitely a value-for-money proposition, especially in its diesel AT form. I initially booked the Kia Sonet on the first of July 2022 from the Incheon Kia dealership in Thrissur and the booking was made for the 7-speed Turbo DCT HTX variant. The test drive had gone well and I booked it without any further thoughts, but over the next few days, I began to hear excellent reviews of the Seltos and Creta's diesel engine and thought why not go for the diesel with the Sonet, so I immediately asked for the test drive from the dealership and the same was arranged within the next day. The test drive changed my opinion about diesel altogether. The car was so silent with hardly any vibrations unlike the diesel of old and the instant torque and smooth torque converter AT gearbox of the car made me switch from petrol to diesel, moreover knowing that the engine and gearbox are the same as the one on the Seltos and Creta with the same tuning made me feel that it definitely was the better choice, So the booking was revised and a tentative waiting period of 3 to 4 months was given to me and the wait began. It was on 12th October when I finally got a call from my sales executive that the car had completed production and was ready for dispatch. On 17th October, the vehicle arrived at the dealership, we immediately went for the PDI, and funds were transferred for the car as well after the PDI. The car was ready for delivery on 25th October 2022 but since it wasn't the best day for delivery due to a solar eclipse on that day, we went for delivery on 26th October. The dealership organized a delivery ceremony and cake-cutting as well, they even had a present for us at the event too. The joy of driving the car out of the dealership was out of this world. Moving on to the car itself, our car is a Black HTX Diesel AT which I feel is the most value-for-money diesel automatic you could get in the segment. The features on the HTX variant are just a notch below that of the GTX+ variant. The car definitely features packed for the price with an 8-inch touchscreen with reverse camera and wireless Android auto, semi leatherette seats, sunroof, rear AC vents, all requisite safety features like ABS, EBD, Hill Assist, VSM, Traction control modes, drive modes, 4 airbags, etc. The car is reasonably spacious and has a large 392-liter boot as well. On the exterior, led headlamps, tail lamps, DRLs, foglights, diamond cut alloys and shark fin antenna all add to the flair of the car. Moving forward to the drive over the past two weeks, it is definitely super smooth and the mileage over the past two weeks has been great too. The features on offer, fit, finish and quality levels are exemplary as well. I am absolutely satisfied with the car and would recommend anyone looking for an automatic compact SUV to try out this vehicle. You would definitely be impressed. It's definitely a mini-Seltos in every way and an excellent value-for-money proposition at the same time. No wonder it's selling like hotcakes and why Kia has been a hit in the market in such a short time.", "author": "By yedu krishnan", "date": "On: Nov 08, 2022  | 3988 Views"}

I am truly disappointed as my previously owned Grand i10 was far superior in terms of overall performance. The performance of the vehicle is only good in the 4th &5th gears. On 2nd gear, power lag is more prominent. While reversing in muddy areas, the engine of SONET appears to be giving away. Kia doesn't let you test drive HTK plus petrol instead they provide a turbo one that performs better than HTK plus petrol. In one sentence, SONET HTK plus petrol is a goat in the tiger's skin.

Never felt any kind of uncomfortable feeling or harshness while passing through these roads. I would say these journeys were really comfortable in my Sonet. 20.5 mm ground clearance helped to cross broken sections with ease.

{"modelSlug": "sonet", "rating": 4.5, "title": "GOOD CAR FOR CITY USE. HTX IMT TURBO IS VALUE FOR MONEY", "content": "Just got this car recently. HTX IMT TURBO in red color. Firstly, the finish of the red color is one of the best in the industry and segment. Feels very rich. The interior qualities are mind-blowing. I sure you feel like you are sitting in a much expensive car. The seating position is also amazing. Now about the drive quality, the IMT has no lag at all since it's similar to the manual. The engine refinement is superb and you do not get head nods on turbo kicks. The side support on the seats on the front is good. The back seems a bit stiff and upright. The black beige interiors are also lovely and pleasing to the eye. Better than all-black interiors. The negatives in my whole experience to date is firstly mileage is poor. Being a brand new car and complete Mumbai usage, I'm getting 8-9kmpl. Expecting this to increase above 10 after some time and service. The new breaks kick in hard which can get risky because of traffic behind you. My car went from the showroom to the service center the same day of delivery because the AC was not cooling because of some software issue. Also, the speakers at the back are as good as not present. The tweeters might be louder than those speakers. I might get those changed soon. Overall I'm pleased by the car till now and it gives me a pleasure to drive and a positive vibe every time I get in.", "author": "By ashish mehta", "date": "On: Apr 05, 2021  | 4556 Views"}

I drove as of now 600 km's, below are the main 2 points I noticed. 1) Reverse gear has too much lag, out of 10 times only once. Your car will move backwards immediately remain 8 times it was like did I really change the gear to R mode? or any stone behind the tyre? do I need to touch the accelerator for immediate response? Trust me after changing the gear to R mode and taking off your leg from the brake pedal you can pick your water bottle, open the cap, drink a sip of water then you notice the car started moving reverse/backwards, that much lag- Even I kept me both legs folded on to the seat and shown my friend to see the magic my both legs are folded see after 1 to 2 min your car starts backwards. 2) Don't test drive a car in small streets and buy it. If possible request then definitely need to test drive on the high way with a min of 80 speed, because I felt lag while overtaking. Sport mode choose is not possible at that critical/emergency overtaking time, your decision on of overtaking judgment matters on 80 speed, you just can't look down use the left hand to press the mode button, then choose cluster screen select Sport then use accelerator this is full of diversion and impossible to do end up in an accident. did any 7 Dct owners notice reverse gear lag/not working immediately? please let me know. thank you.", "author": "By rakesh ch", "date": "On: Mar 26, 2021  | 809 Views"}

I\u00a0want to highlight both good points and not so good points.\u00a0Good points: 1.The performance of the car. Having driven AMT\u00a0earlier, this car is superb in pickup and overall road performance. It feels sporty and I\u00a0always felt enthralled while driving it even in tight spots or open roads.\u00a0It reaches 100 kmph in no time. The handling even at high speed is superb and you always feel in control of the car. Braking at high speed is again pretty good and you feel confident. 2. Look and features are superb in this price bracket and I\u00a0really doubt any other car in this price bracket provides such a package of looks, power and features. Speaker quality is quite good given that it is not Bose and an in-house speaker. I had to do a few modifications in the speaker settings to get the best output. 3. Imt transmission is smooth though gear shifting for me was a little hard in the beginning as I was not used to this transmission. 4. Best part- service- from car sales to the first service I have never felt so good in terms of the overall experience. I called my sales advisor when I felt an issue in my car (which was nothing but my inexperience with transmission). He immediately came to my house with one of their service people and looked into the issue. They did not say anything when they found it was nothing but even guided me on the overall transmission and car handling process. That was awesome! Even during the service and after I have been getting calls from both Kia service center and company on the service experience and it is really good. The service advisor doesn't force you to buy anything extra, Though they will suggest so. Not so good points: 1.Mileage- even after my first service, I am getting mileage of 9-10 kmpl. The company promises 18.2, So I am expecting at least 13-14 in the city and 18 on highways. I have not travelled more than 50-60 km in one stretch, So it is still to be tested on long routes. 2.Creep mode- I have faced few issues with creep mode particularly in a reverse mode where even on flat surfaces sometimes it doesn't work smoothly.

They have introduced Kia Sonet in India in September just before the Festival and wedding season. A lot of people have booked this car since September so that they can have a new car by Diwali or on their anniversary or any other celebrations and as a gift to their son or daughter at the wedding. Kia has happily considered all the bookings assuring delivery by 4-5 weeks or say a maximum of 6 weeks. But they are failing to give the deliveries. Also, most of the people have booked htk+ or the htx imt model considering its range. But now Kia is not only delaying the deliveries beyond 9 weeks, but they are also giving some lame excuses stating that the production is slow during this time of the year. If that is a case why did you introduced this car at this time of the year and why this was not informed to the customer. Secondly, since the htx model is not available, Kia is forcing the customers to opt for htx+ which is 2lakh extra cost. I don't understand if the production is slow at this time of the year why are you unnecessarily producing htx+ while the booking of htx is in abundance. So basically the strategy is first to grab all the booking amount and secondly to forcefully sell htx+. Well if you know marketing we also know marketing. Stop this else we customers can drag you to the court as without delivery you are also forcing your customers to start the loan EMIs.", "author": "By madan manalisha", "date": "On: Nov 23, 2020  | 4758 Views"}

The EV6's performance capabilities, including its quick acceleration, would likely make it a fun and exciting vehicle to drive, while its spacious and tech-forward interior would provide a comfortable and convenient driving experience. One potential downside of owning an electric vehicle like the Kia EV6 is the need to regularly charge the vehicle's battery, which could require some adjustment in terms of daily routines and planning for longer trips. However, the ability to charge the vehicle quickly, with the ability to add up to 70 miles of range in just five minutes of charging, would help mitigate this concern. Overall, owning a Kia EV6 would likely be a positive experience, given the vehicle's impressive range, performance, and design features, as well as the increasing availability of charging infrastructure to support electric vehicles.", "author": "By sohail anjum", "date": "On: Mar 08, 2023  | 114 Views"}

The door handles are flush units, and at the bottom, a character line flows across both doors and then rises sharply to visually merge into the very dramatic tail-light unit that stretches right across the rear.

Sensors in the front, back and sides are must for city driving. Regret it is not a part of standard equipment. Bit of more legroom is suggested. Seats are comfortable and also ergonomic. The gap between steering wheel and seat needs an upgrade. I\u00a0mean a little more. As fatty drivers find difficult to maneouvre the steering wheel easily. White colour is very attractive apart from ref. Rest are dull. Stepney space shouldvhave been provided.so that boot room is more spacious.

Beginning with the things, I love about the car is the whole exterior. LED Headlamps, the aggressive grille, the bonnet scoop, and the backlights. It appeals to me as an overall package oozing strength when looked from the outside. The driving is eased by the smooth gear shifts compared to the higher segments. It also has\u00a0the most affordable for 4 seaters with the kind of features like reverse camera, navigation and cruise control. Now coming to the downside, having driven it for more than 200000 km, I can tell that the car certainly lacks stability when it comes to rough patches on the road. The body roll also becomes an issue when travelling uphills. The upholstery also requires a major upgrade as the interior doesn't cope up with the exterior. Overall, the car has been a reliable partner in all my journeys. The captain seats help me with the cover a good amount of km without any worries. The mileage also is around 15km\u00a0if driven well in the city and 19 km on the highway which is pretty good for a car of this size. The pickup has also been no issue for its powerful engine.

In the last 5 months, the car broke down twice in the middle of the road right in rush-hour traffic during my drive. One can't imagine the pain and chaos when this happens. The car just stopped and wouldn't start no matter what you tried to do. The first time it happened, about 45 days from the time of purchase, the car was taken back by the service center for rectifying the fault. After about a week, they gave back the car assuring me that the issue has been resolved. But to my horror, I had to go through the same nightmarish experience and the car had to be towed by their rescue team. The car is now with the dealership at their service center, for 2 weeks, and the Merc and the dealership team have not been able to identify or rectify the problem.

It has all practical features which are daily required and no other gimmick features that others offer nowadays. Basically, I was searching for a driver's car, I am myself a driving enthusiast. Its high points are 1. Driving dynamics: it's so planted in highways, it glides through the potholes. In Hindi chipak kar chalta hai. 2. Comfort: leave the highway drive, it's comfortable in offroading too. 3. High ground clearance of 210 mm: trust me it is very good to have that ground clearance in hill areas. I am from Arunachal Pradesh high ground clearance is very useful here. 4. Controlled body roll: very little body roll on turns. 5. Steering feedback: I like its hydraulic steering, you don't have to rotate much while on turns. 6. Breaking: breaking is smooth and the bite is good. Never had a breaking issue at 120 mph. 7. Seat comfort: some say its seat is hard it may hurt on a long drive. But trust me science says a bit stiff seat is good for a long drive and I felt super comfortable at a 400km drive in a stretch. 8. Headlight throw: I never felt I need to upgrade. Its headlight through at night is better than other rivals. 8. Boot\u00a0space: when it was launched it had one of the largest boot spaces in its segment. It's sufficient for me 9. Safety: My XV Pre optional has 4 airbags, graphene body, EBD\u00a0with ESP or VDC, hill start assist, large ORVm, good grip Apollo tyres, automatic wiper and headlamp and many more. Negatives are minor and are not deal-breakers that I can live with. It fulfilled all my requirements. The only issue for its lesser sell may be due to lack of information not penetrated to masses. It's so underrated car. Test drive all vehicles in its segment and come to my review to be verified. Others think that parts availability would be an issue. For new vehicles, I had no issues faced. For the first five years,\u00a0only small running repairs and servicing are required like a brake pad, engine oil, oil filter, air filter which are all available at the dealer. Secondly, I have a 5years warranty purchased that keeps me peace of mind. Any other major parts required due to accident will take little time but it's the same with other brands too. I had Maruti Celerio, it's the same with that. Trust me Maruti Celerio serving cost was a little more than Kicks taking into account that Kicks is bigger than Celerio's. And my mother has Scorpio S11. So in my opinion a true car enthusiast will acknowledge Kicks value and remember there are other things also besides \"bhed chall\".", "author": "By limo kato", "date": "On: Mar 05, 2022  | 6222 Views"}

Pros: Build Quality is awesome for both outside and inside. The plastics feel tough and built to the last suspension can handle broken roads, smooth roads, potholes, off-road very well and one does not feel the impact of bad roads inside. Highway stability is very good. The car feels planted and confident at speeds. 156 BHP\u00a0Power from 1.3 Petrol turbo is noticeable after 1600rpm and comes as a surge and keeps pulling. This constant surge is even more useful in the automatic version as there is almost no drop in the revs across all the CVT steps. Very useful during highway overtakes. Transmission: The transmission is very smooth and silent and is able to handle all load levels. Hill hold assist is a very useful feature and it works very intuitively. The ergonomics of the car is very good. The passengers and I have travelled for 12 hours continuously through a mix of bad and good roads and were surprised that none felt tiredness or anybody aches. The seats are supportive and the controls are within easy reach. The boot is wide and the low loading lip makes it very convenient to load /unload luggage. The speakers are good. Cons: The projector's light strength could have been better. Summary: I would very strongly recommend the car especially the 1.3 CVT It may not seem interesting or enticing at a passing glance, but once you have taken a test drive it will definitely make you think about considering it. One of the best cars around and best suited for Indian conditions. I needed a car that can travel long distances be it through good or bad roads at respectable speeds and keep me or\u00a0my family cocooned through the journey, and that I don't have to worry about taking an offbeat route.

After accidentally stepped inside Autorelli Nissan to see Magnite but ended up test driving CVT Kicks! That changed the whole game! The driving dynamics, ride quality, intelligent I-SVPT suspension, traction control, dynamic stability control, hill start assist, 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, tinted glasses (it wasn't there in Hyundai and CRETA at ? 17-?18 lakhs cars), bigger dimensions, graphite superior body structure, Mercedes Benz Engine mated with efficient CVT gearbox gives me fuel efficiency around 19kmpl on highways and around 12kmpl in heavy city traffic conditions. The stock sound system seems to be far superior and inside the cabin, there is very minimal noise you could hear from outside hence all sorts of music notes can be heard easily. NissanConnect, NFC Keyless entry is cool. Nissan Kicks has Auto-On & Auto-Off Engine option which really helpful in traffic lights waiting, saving fuel by running in the battery. AC is very good and even during a long trip with 4-5 people, the AC performance is good. Boot space is very huge for a normal family trip. So far Autorelli Nissan is responding to my queries and hence I don't see a big issue wrt support or service.", "author": "By ramachandran ", "date": "On: Sep 30, 2021  | 1011 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 5, "title": "The Younger SUV", "content": "So\u00a0Finally, a resilient competitor in the segment of SUV has come into the market. Nowadays most of the car buyers are preferring SUVs instead of Hatchback/Sedan. That's why many car makers are focusing on the compact SUV type designs and Nissan Kicks is one of them. Exterior Nissan has given a sporty appearance to the car. Perfect & pretty chrome finish on the front adding class in the look of Nissan Kicks and 17-inch alloy wheels looks pretty impressive. Interior: Now coming to the interior, chocolaty coloured leather finish on dashboard & seats, leather-wrapped steering & gear knob with chrome finish looks delightful in the cabin. 8-inch touch screen display with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay & speakers are also available for your long trip entertainment and 400-litre boot space on the back is more than enough for your bulky luggage. Engine specifications: Now going towards the engine specifications & variants, Nissan offers 1498 cc petrol & 1461 cc diesel engine, which can produce 104 bhp with 145 NM peak torque & 108 bhp with 248 NM peak torque respectively. Kicks Petrol and Diesel variants are giving standard mileage of 14.23 kmpl & 19.39 kmpl respectively. Petrol variants are available with a 5-speed manual transmission & Diesel variants with a 6-speed manual transmission. However, diesel engines are too noisy but the better insulation to the cabin can reduce the noise and won't allow it to penetrate into the cabin. So, by considering this aspect Nissan has given extremely better insulation in its diesel variants. Safety: While purchasing a car customer should not ignore the safety aspects. So, considering that aspects Nissan Kicks is fully loaded with the needed safety features like ABS with EBD, Brake Assist, Vehicle Dynamic Control (same as stability control) & dual airbags. You can have 2 more airbags in its top variant. As per my personal experience, during the test drive, I have checked braking & stability control and it was comparatively better than the other available crossovers. Extra Features: Nissan has provided many advanced features like Cruise Control, Hill Start Assist, Day time LED lights, Cornering Lights with Fog Lamps & Rain-Sensing Wipers but the key feature which has given first time in this segment is Rear cameras with 360 degrees around view monitor. You can use this feature while forward movement of the car in heavy traffic as well. Cons: As we all know all products have their own pros & cons. So, coming to the cons, 1) Nissan Kicks is not available with 4 wheel drive variants but with the high ground clearance of 210 mm & very balanced suspension system, it won't disappoint you on an off-road ride. 2) Adjustments of seats are manual only, which could be an electronic adjustment. 3) Adjustment of steering is the only tilted type, however, the telescopic adjustment is not there. 4) Individual door locking/unlocking knobs are missing. So, the individual passenger cannot lock/unlock their door separately. 5) Automatic variants are not available so manual transmission is the only option. But these cons are ignorable, so if you are thinking about\u00a0buying this one then it is a worth buying car.", "author": "By kishan h chauhan", "date": "On: Mar 29, 2019  | 117 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 5, "title": "Nissan Kicks, Made For Stylish Buyers", "content": "Nissan has recently introduced the most stylish SUV, Kicks. It's been around two months now and the car is doing fairly well in the market. The new Nissan Kicks is longer than any other SUVs in the segment as it's wider than Creta and comes loaded with a plethora of features. Nissan Kicks competes against the likes in the compact SUV segment such as Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, Renault Captur and Hyundai Creta. New Nissan Kicks offers the buyers an exceptional mixture of premium-ness, stylish interiors, a spacious cabin and much more. The list is quite long and I am quite pleased with the overall looks of the vehicle. The best part is that Nissan Kicks can be personalized with about 27 different accessory categories and can be tailor-made as per the customer?s choice. The stylish design is complemented by improved performance and amazing driving dynamics. On the outside, its overall design is quite funky and is good for the buyers who like their car to stand out in the crowd. The front features V-motion radiator grille that looks bold, the front end looks squarish. The SUV is available in a dual-tone exterior theme that looks quite amazing. The rear part gets boomerang tail lamps which are of course a unique style element. Checking the interiors, it's the department which attracts me a lot. The black and brown interior color scheme looks plush. Leather finish on the seats and steering makes the cabin feels rich. The SUV gets 8-inch floating touchscreen display that works well with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Nissan Kicks is powered by 1.5L diesel and petrol engine. The petrol oil burner delivers power output of 106PS and belts out the maximum torque of 142Nm and comes mated to 5-speed manual gearbox. Its diesel mill generates 110PS of power output and yields 240Nm of maximum torque. The diesel engine comes with 6-speed manual transmission. The safety features\u00a0are also quite amazing, it gets rear parking sensors, ABS with EBD, dual from airbags, brake assist, speed-sensing auto lock and rear defogger as standard. Other features are follow-me-home headlamps, rearview camera and front side airbags in top trims. So, I can say that Nissan Kicks is the perfect piece of machine for the buyers who are looking for a stylish compact SUV along with various premium features.", "author": "By pradeep", "date": "On: Mar 14, 2019  | 166 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 3, "title": "Nissan Kicks -  i20 Active Rs. 4.5 Lakh Cheaper", "content": "The newly launched Nissan Kicks has been gathering attention all these days. And it should be as it is a global product and launched after Nissan Terrano failed in the Indian market. The car has been carefully designed to match up to the rivals in the segment including Hyundai Creta and Renault Captur. Just 2 months back I purchased i20 Active and I am delighted that it is still the value for money deal in Rs. 10 lakh. I am not saying Kicks is a bad car but if you don't want to spend extra Rs. 4-5 lakhs and want the same set of features in another car, then go for i20 Active. In terms of looks also, I think i20 Active appears stylish and more aggressive than the Kicks. I know these cars fall in the different segment but nowadays every new compact SUV is launched, the upper segment is definitely affected. You get a whole lot of features in i20 Active such as touchscreen infotainment powered by Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and Navigation, rear view camera, cooled glove box, projector headlamps, automatic climate control, rear ac vents, engine start/stop button, 6 airbags and tons of other features. What else you need? I know it is weird to compare these two cars but honestly, if you have a tight budget of around Rs. 10 lakhs, the i20 Active seems to be more value for money deal. You do get never seen features in Kicks such as 360-degree camera and contemporary aspects such as larger 8-inch infotainment but on the downside, you only get 4 airbags, a feature which is a must if you are spending Rs. 15 lakhs. Kicks is also a good car but if you are not serious on spending Rs. 15 lakhs, Hyundai i20 Active can also offer contemporary styling and features in an Rs. 10 lakh price range. It's just my opinion.", "author": "By sushi", "date": "On: Jan 31, 2019  | 74 Views"}
{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 5, "title": "Nissan Kicks  Longer Wider And Cheaper Than Creta", "content": "Nissan first stint in the compact SUV segment did not meet the expectations of the Indian car buyers. With Terrano, it honestly failed to appease the youth but this time around, it has come with altogether a different strategy. The Japanese automaker has finally rolled out the Kicks compact SUV cum crossover in the segment with the motive of offering a decent alternative for the Creta lovers. Just yesterday I was discussing this car with one of my friends and he said, I agree Kicks is better priced than Creta but the latter is bigger and looks more like an SUV than the former. I said you have a misunderstanding just like many other people. Dimensionally, Kicks is 4384mm in length and 1813mm in width as well as it has better wheelbase and ground clearance at 2673mm and 210mm respectively, as against Creta's 4270mm, 1780mm, 2590mm, and 190mm in that order. The reason why Creta looks bigger is that of slightly increased height. And secondly, people have been seeing Creta on every other street for the past few years that's why it has gone overboard. The better dimensions of Kicks means it is spacious from inside and offers a better legroom, headroom and knee room for the passengers. The exterior styling and cabin quality is also top notch in Kicks. In my opinion, Nissan has carefully designed and sensibly priced this car given the competition in the segment and also it did not want to repeat the failure of Terrano. The top-end petrol variant of Nissan Kicks will cost just Rs. 10.95 lakh while the same for the Creta will cost you Rs. 14.15 lakh. So you are paying Rs. 3.2 lakh more for a couple of additional airbags, sunroof, and a few more features. And I personally think the sunroof is just a useless feature in cars. And even if you opt for the diesel variant of Kicks it is still value for money as it gives you features such as 360-degree camera and larger 8-inch touchscreen infotainment. Also, if you see Kicks? lower variants have been decently equipped for the price and every variant offers you ample features. So on paper, it seems Nissan Kicks is well kitted and aptly priced. If you don't want to spend Rs. 15-16 lakh on Creta, Nissan Kicks can be a better option for you.", "author": "By sushi", "date": "On: Jan 31, 2019  | 61 Views"}

I am sure the Kicks has\u00a0taken it further and is for sure a great product overall with its fantastic looks, road presence, and features. As a competitor for the Creta, I think it is a good option for the buyer. As there are plenty of Cretas all over.

{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 3, "title": "Nissan Kicks  The Trendsetter Has ArrivedBut", "content": "Since I have been following updates about Nissan Kicks for a long time, I would like to write a short review on how I feel about this car. The new compact SUV from Nissan launched at Rs. 9.55 lakh is a special one for so many reasons. The car is based on Renault-Nissan's low-cost alternative platform MO which is meant for developing markets and the same platform from which Terrano, Duster, and Captur have been carved out. The car is available in both 1.5L diesel and 1.5L petrol engines both of which have been tried and tested. I liked the way the carmaker has bestowed this car with oodles of comfort out of which some segment first including a 360-degree camera and leather covered dashboard. Other notable comfort features in the car include rain sensing wipers, automatic headlamps, cooled glove box, climate control, quilted leather seats and 8-inch touchscreen infotainment powered by Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. On the safety front too, this car scores well with standard features includes dual airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors and rear defogger. The top end variants get additional 2 airbags, rear fog lamps and hill start assist. The car has been pretty much equipped. Like its sibling Renault Captur, the Nissan Kicks also gets tons of single and dual color paint options. But! Will it be able to beat Creta since looking at the fact that it is only available in a manual transmission? I think the car would have a hard time getting things right for itself. Automatics are increasingly being preferred by new car buyers and lacking this vital option would surely distract many buyers. Also, Nissan should have added other vitals such as the sunroof, powered driver seat, wireless charging and other cool features to make this car stand shoulder to shoulder to rivals. On the other hand, what I liked the most that the car has been priced sensibly with the top end model available at Rs. 13 lakhs, unlike Creta which is exorbitantly priced. So from a pricing perspective, it seems Nissan Kicks will directly rival Maruti S-Cross in the segment. To me it seems this car is a mixed bag, rest time will tell how people take this car.", "author": "By karan", "date": "On: Jan 22, 2019  | 56 Views"}

{"modelSlug": "kicks", "rating": 3, "title": "Nissan Kicks  Still Behind Creta in Features", "content": "Nissan is set to launch its much-awaited Kicks compact SUV in the Indian market soon. It would be the second such attempt by the Japanese carmaker in the compact SUV segment where car such as Hyundai Creta is ruling the roost. Nissan has realized its mistake with the Terrano and now want to rectify it by launching a contemporary and feature-rich product of what is liked by most consumers today. And yes, Nissan Kicks would be loaded up to the brim with features such as 360-degree camera, 8-inch floating touchscreen infotainment unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, automatic AC, LED projector headlamps and 17-inch alloy wheels. The 360-degree camera feature is a first in a class segment, in fact not available in several segments above. The feature is usually seen in Rs. 25-30 lakh car. Then there are features such as push-button start, automatic headlights, automatic rain sensing wipers, cooled glove box, cornering lamps and cruise control which makes it stand in the class of premium vehicles out there. But on the other hand, what surprised me the most is that the car comes only with 6 airbags in the top end model which is really a downside from the carmaker as Kicks is being touted as the premium car in the segment. Hyundai Creta comes with 6 airbags and that too with the automatic variant. Creta also comes with sunroof which really gives it an upper edge over Kicks. Some other breathtaking features which is not offered in Kicks include wireless smartphone charging, electrically adjustable driver seat and electrochromic mirror. In terms of styling, however, the carmaker has given a funky and fun-to-drive design something which is not seen in the Indian market before. All eyes remain on the pricing though, if it undercuts Hyundai Creta by a handsome margin then it could make a mark in the segment. The top end model of Creta costs around Rs. 18 lakhs (on-road), if Nissan can manage to close the price bracket well within Rs. 15 lakhs, I think it would be a great buy.", "author": "By rakesh", "date": "On: Dec 15, 2018  | 266 Views"}

The service centres are unreliable they sometimes make you bills of things which don't exist in your car (this has happened twice) and as much as it breaks my heart to say the entire clutch broke and it cost me a hefty penny to change. For a make and supposed quality of Skoda, it's galling for their vehicle to have worst parts which break down quickly and their service people call us to reply that it was somehow my mistake their clutch broke down so quickly. (The clutch also doesn't get covered in an extended warranty beware) To date I love my car it's a pleasure to drive but I somehow wish we as Indians could do over Skoda service centres and have other compassionate and reliable service people.", "author": "By obuli ramachandran nandhakumar", "date": "On: Sep 20, 2022  | 4087 Views"}

Skoda Kushaq Is like a king as they said a very comfortable and driver-oriented car. Designs are more elegant and symphonic and eye-catching. Size is not like the king's standard it's very compact and narrow compared to its own class. Size becomes\u00a0less standard to its class. The engines are 1.5 is good compared to 1L\u00a0because 1L\u00a0have little noise in the cabin, I think they fooled us they give polo for 13L only the body changed..this engine suits for polo. Noisy, vibration. I think no long-lasting engine because of the heavy workload of the 1L engine Quality makes King Kushaq, not at all german. It's a cross-breed of Indians. then also we like its Price it is ok for the german not for the 1L.

Overall a good experience with the vehicle around comfort, drivability, and safety. Pretty stable both in low and high speed and easy to maneuver in bumper-to-bumper traffic and tight spots. Comfy seats, ample leg space, a good audio system, and a decent-sized sunroof add more fun to the drives and journey. German engineering is at its best in this vehicle as the 1 ltr turbo gives enough push to drive at 120+ KM on highways without much effort. The feel of the drive is just amazing. In fact, the gearbox is probably the best in this segment after test driving its Korean siblings. It has a pretty strong road grip and cut the corners without much body roll and hassles. The steering is a bit on the lighter side pretty decent in both low and high speed too. The mileage is averaged around 10-11 on city roads and 14-15 on highways with full AC on. There are still a few areas of improvement required in this vehicle like improving the parking camera resolution, better horn befitting Skoda brand, noisy windows, deep clutch (which might be a problem for old people), and sometimes a minor vibration sound in low RPM making the cabin bit noisy.

The engine really kicks in around the 1500 rpm mark. Pros: 1. Engine and\u00a0gearbox combination\u00a0gives a very sporty feel to the car.\u00a0No problems in overtaking. 2. Automatic is heaven for city driving\u00a0was stuck in a traffic jam.\u00a0Bumper-to-bumper\u00a0effortless driving without getting tired. 3. Gear changing is very smooth\u00a0with no jerkiness at all. 4. Steering is very light.\u00a0Can shift to S mode on the highway, adds to heaviness to the wheel while driving at higher speeds. 5. Suspension, slightly on the stiffer side.\u00a0Got feedback that the car is very comfortable, on longer drives by rear passengers. It can swallow moderate potholes, and speed breakers with ease. 6. Seat cushioning is very good and provides ample support for the back, and shoulders. Additionally, the driver seat position provides an excellent view.\u00a0You can position it all the way up (my height being 5.10'')\u00a0and still have ample headroom. 7. Telematics and\u00a0auto android connectivity is very good.\u00a0The interface is very smooth and fast.

The looks are absolutely stunning.\u00a0Have got a lot of people\u00a0coming up to me, and asking about the car. 9. Cornering lamp function\u00a0is amazing, and really helps during nighttime driving, as it extends the visibility while taking turns. 10. Skoda offers a 3-year paint warranty.\u00a0So no need to get a Teflon coating or wax shine on the body. 11. Driver MID(Multi-information display)\u00a0is minimalistic. But has the retro feel of RPM and Speedometer. It's in Black and white but has all the features such as service date, music controls, telephone calls, etc. 12. Paddle shifters are really good, have a smart function of automatically reverting back to driving mode, after some time\u00a0perfect for overtaking.\u00a0When you need a little bit of extra power on the tap. 13. The headlight throw is very good.\u00a0I really don't like people driving on high beams (white light dazzling), especially during the night. A little adjustment to the setting makes the light just perfect for not dazzling the oncoming vehicle. Cons: 1. Co-drivers seat is not height-adjustable, not expected in this price point. 2. Reverse camera quality could be better, also should have included dynamic guidelines. 3. Could have given additional cladding for the engine to make better soundproofing.

I keep getting updates from their Insta page that Skoda is literally on a showroom and service center opening spree across India. So I am sure servicing and maintenance won't be an issue apart from the fact that Kushaq has strived for 90% localisation. The only con I felt is the width of the SUV could have been segment leading like the wheelbase which is\u00a0segment-leading. The width feels like the third-person on the rear will be unwelcome. It's picture perfect for 4 passengers though. Massive Speed Breaker Unplanned Test: During the test drive, I was at 90+ speed and didn't notice there was a big size speed breaker hump and I really didn't have the time to break. I just let the Kushaq go over the hump. There was a loud sound \"Dhund\" And I got really scared if I had damaged the test drive vehicle. But you know what, apart from the thud, the car didn't loose control even for a bit. The steering was totally in my control.

Unique 2-spoke steering wheel (from Superb, Octavia) Kushaq has a 385ltr capacity that can easily fit the same baggage as Creta/Seltos (claim 400+ltrs.) Carbon Steel paint finish looks very nice, upmarket, and premium. 6-speaker audio system is surprisingly crisp and has great sound with a subwoofer. Negatives: - The steering feels a bit too light even at high speeds and could've weighed up better for a more responsive feel though controlling, it is precise.\u00a0Rear disk brake.\u00a0Digital instrument cluster. No 6 airbags other than 1.0 MT - this is illogical and stupidity. Yes, priced 50k to 70k on the higher side but performance, safety features (even in base models), and the driving experience of both 1.0 and 1.5-litre TSI variants somewhat justify the price.

Mileage is about in city 13-14 ad highway 20+ with hard foot on driving 100 or plus. Tank to tank I get is around 18 with mixed driving. 5 stars in Latin NCAP for the made-in-India Virtus. As I own the 6-airbag Topline variant which was tested in Latin NCAP. Who needs 4 discs when it just stops at the command? Awesome braking. Driving dynamics are just top-notch. It makes me confident at high speed. The Interior is just next level designed. with all safety features equipped. No\u00a0service cost for me as purchased the SVP pack for 4 years at 24k. Best aftersales service. They are not like Maruti doesn't even offer water. They come to my home which is 50kms just to fix my issues at my doorstep. Awesome 8 speakers and sound system.

We have a lot of known issues with the car or you can say manufacturing issues. 1) Air condition is faulty. It's not just my car but in all the units they have manufactured so far. A/C will throw hot air instead of cold or sometimes will throw something like fog or smoke instead of air. 2) Break pads are making the sound. Just after a month's usage, you will hear sounds while you apply break. In both slow and high speed. 3) Vibrations in the car are way too much. You can see the passenger seat shaking with vibration when you are standing at a red light. Although driver does not feel that much vibration until you touch the gear shifter. 4) Boot button does not do anything on the key. 5) Average is pretty inconsistent. It was earlier 10-15 but last week it dropped to 7-8. I am driving the same route with the same traffic and style. VW is not making any effort to resolve this. The issue with AC and brakes is something they should work on. I have seen other brands in the past fixing manufacturing defects like this. Few things you will like about the car -Power. It has a refined Polo engine so you get great power behind the wheel after passing 1600-1700 RPM. - Decent sound system and starting controls.\u00a0", "author": "By aman", "date": "On: Jul 14, 2022  | 20589 Views"}

Well, it's probably not going to be his first buy,\u00a0but not his first luxury on wheels. The Jeep looks good and\u00a0it is imposing, majestic and a big head-turner. The engine is surprisingly sprightly for a beast of this size and\u00a0I didn't expect the car to respond to the call for power so well. Jeep has indeed put some oomph on the throttle. The unlimited version offers a smoother ride in the city with the rubicon. Cabin noise at high speeds, the general stiff rear seating, lack of the essential electronic gadgets that are a must even in entry-level cars is a bit of a bummer. But then you have to accept the fact that it ain't your regular car. It's a jeep,\u00a0but that said the new instrument cluster, the interior lighting, and the A/C are all a good effort to make an offroader feel good and creditworthy even if they don't match up to the other SUVs in the market.

As a car it has amazing power and handling, issues are something that hurts me a lot, like no rear recline seat - as seats are too reclined to the straight position, it doesn't give comfort for long rides. Would have gone to limited options for more features just Jeep was offering real leather seats so one issue for people who avoid leather seats and compromise on some features but save lots of bucks. I believe Jeep should evolve with sustainable or cruelty-free material so India is more comfortable and drive with guilt-free rides, customers could look for a car like this if small origin-oriented features like the rear seat issue are resolved height of the rear seat with a view of the window is not suited to average height person in India. Maintainance cost is too high as they priced it with Harrier but competing with somehow more than Harrier comparatively or more than Skoda less than BMW that's not at all suited for many customers.

Then we saw the interiors - I was particularly happy with Dual Tone Interiors and to date, I am very happy with it as it gives a visually appealing interior and a clear view, big and clear ground clearance of 225 mm - very apt for today's kind of roads we have everywhere when I took test drive I was highly impressed by its pick-up and engine smoothness, being ladder-frame chassis it was tough built and seemed to last forever. This is a much better value proposition with respect to everything. Pros: Smooth 2.5 L engine Solid Built quality, built to last, Nice mileage, Fabric seats are very good as they don't get heated during summers. The seat is really comfortable for long drives. Once I did Delhi to Amritsar in a single day and it was very comfortable. Cons: Latest model in International Markets is not yet launched in India Lack of features a Limited number of dealerships Small Diesel tank of 55 L, and a limited range Isuzu is very slow in updating the models, even the current model with a 1.9 L engine is nowhere as compared to Hilux in interiors and quality, features, etc.", "author": "By manish pandey", "date": "On: Sep 01, 2022  | 2625 Views"}

The ride quality of the car is mind-boggling, how it passes through the bad roads without disturbing the passengers is just amazing. Does the car change it's driving compatibilities according to the drive mode set by the driver and actually rocks in every aspect? The attention to detail is absolutely phenomenal and grabs the attention of almost every person passing by. The headlights are so powerful and wide, they actually give you the view of 500-600 meters ahead. The instrument cluster of the car is so helpful and full of information of the car, it is very fluid to use and even maintains the service records of the car, the 21 speaker setup of the bose audio system is just amazing and gives you a theatrical feel.

Volvo India, one of the most accepted luxury brands internationally, introduced XC90 SUV a few years back. The car has already been serving various global automobile markets and with the launch in the Indian market, it has certainly strengthened the brand footprints. In the country, Volvo XC90 is launched in two trims that are Inscription and Momentum. XC90 is the feast to watch, the body is very cleanly designed, only with smooth lines and no quirky curves on the vehicle. The stance is laid back but looks quite aggressive while DRLs and big chrome radiator grille add to the aura. Just like its exteriors, interiors too are minimalist but not in term of quality. Every single surface or button show signs of quality. In terms of space, Volvo XC90 is great while the seats are par with excellence. The cabin is fully incorporated with luxury featuring adaptive cruise control, panoramic roof, 4-zone climate control, parking assist, keyless entry, anti-glare mirrors and a range of driver assist systems. The car gets large centrally mounted touchscreen unit along with entertainment provided by Bowers and Wilkins with a phenomenal set of speakers. Under the hood, XC90 is powered by the 2.0L 4-cylinder diesel mill that can generate the output of 225bhp and maximum torque of 470Nm. The Volvo XC90 is nearly 5m long but conceals its bulk well and doesn?t come across as a behemoth like the Mercedes-Benz GL.

Constant driving on eco mode on highways can give you 11kmpl but if we drive a little dynamic then it quicky drops to 8.5 or 9 kmpl. In city its straight 7kmpl. Headlamps are super effective at night. Cars judgement is very easy and perfect. Electric steering is too smooth. But you will definitely miss ventilated seats. Android auto would have been much easy with bluetooth instead of wired. Wireless charging is pretty much useless as it charges too slow and heats the phone too much. Also its hard for driver to access phone from there. Ample legroom in backseat with very less thigh support. Tall passengers will feel the need for more thigh support. Ingress and egress from rear doors is slight uneasy. Sunroof is really beautiful but mostly useless in india due to dust and extreme sunny situations. Overall car appearance is so beautiful from front & back. The car interestingly looks small & compact from distance while it actually is pretty big compared to the likes of creta or seltos.

And the vehicle becomes even more special when you see that the new model is coming after 15 years of long time. This is what the new 8th generation Rolls Royce Phantom is up to. Fifteen years is a long time and it seems that the arrival of the new Phantom is a momentum occasion like enthronement of a new king to continue the royal bloodline. It will not be an exaggeration to call the Phantom, the king of all cars in the world as it has been in the market since 1925. The ultimate benchmark of luxury and power, new Phantom comes with drastic changes. Aluminium chassis has been used for superior rigidity and fantastic ride quality. There are forward-facing cameras installed on the car that read the road surface, signaling the suspension to adjust its stiffness. The doors which hinge back while opening seems to have been made for access only for royals and kings. The comfort levels of seats with heating cooling and massage, abundance of legroom, wooden inserts on the dashboard, large touchscreens, plush carpeting as well as first in class features like starlight roof and The Gallery truly makes it a car for the kings. To reveal the true monster hidden inside this luxury vehicle, one has to be on the driving seat. The 6.75L V12 engine produces 555hp and massive torque of 900Nm, paired with 8-speed ZF transmission. This takes only 5.3 seconds to hit the 100kmph mark from still while it can reach the top speed of 250kmph. If you love to hear phrases like bang for the buck\u00a0or value for money, you must delete these phrases before purchasing this ultimate luxury.

With its powerful stance, iconic proportions and state-of-the-art technology, Phantom is a timeless interpretation of the modern luxury motor car. The Spirit of Ecstasy leads the way ? with a sense of purpose and presence.When you commission your own Phantom, you choose what statement to make. Create a magical star-filled night sky with 800 individual fibre optic lights hand-fitted into the roof lining. Look sharp with pinstripe tyres and watch holders in the rear door panniers. Whatever personality you wish to project, our Bespoke team can realise it for you.Sixty pairs of highly skilled hands. That?s the level of artisanship that goes into building every Phantom at the Home of Rolls-Royce. Each detail matters ? the five coats of paint on the bodyshell, the bookmatched veneers and the hand-stitched leatherwork. Perfection is our benchmark.It?s the rare sense of scale that defines Phantom and provides such a commanding presence. The wheel proportions and features such as the rear coach doors, Pantheon grille and Spirit of Ecstasy, are all paramount to the Phantom DNA. The classic 2:1 proportions of the wheel-to-body height ratio are immediately apparent. Creating a powerful stance that is heightened by the long wheelbase and bonnet, short front overhangs and deep C-pillars. The elevated body and rear coach doors make entry and exit effortlessly graceful. The curve of the roofline and sweep of the waftability line give the impression of light acceleration even at a standstill. And the Spirit of Ecstasy, which can be requested in stainless steel, solid silver, gold-plate or uplit, gracefully adorns every bonnet and boldly announces your arrival. Phantom is a magnet for attention.As you open Phantom?s rear coach doors, you?re welcomed into an interior that boasts supreme craftsmanship: the feel and scent of soft leather upholstery, and the beauty of the bookmatched veneer that runs throughout the interior. It?s the epitome of contemporary luxury and uncompromising skill. Deep lambswool rugs underfoot, large cocooning C-pillars, umbrellas cleverly concealed in each rear door, three-flute heated seats and a virtually flat floor in the rear compartment: Phantom is the ultimate in comfort. Sit back and relax. The hand-stitched leatherwork takes over two weeks to complete, with nine hides required for each interior. Pre-shrunk and drum-dyed so the colour permeates right through, the leather won?t squeak or crack. Each set of veneers comes from a single tree: walnut, elm, malabar or wenge. Creating a seamless flow of flawless wood from fascia to rear compartment. Onlays or inlays to the veneer add discreet but distinctive touches ? featuring anything from your own initials to a unique design.Phantom?s unique, advanced aluminium spaceframe is hand-welded from over 500 separate parts, making it incredibly lightweight and strong. The state-of-the-art suspension technologies create the air-cushioned ?magic carpet ride? unique to Rolls-Royce.the RR is the short form of the legend ROLLS ROYCE company.

Its signature design is complemented by modern features, with the potential to personalise it to the smallest detail. Born of the desire to build The Best Car in the World, Phantom is the result of complete creative and engineering freedom. When it came to designing the current Phantom Family, its fitting that the influence came from Sir Henry Royce himself: Strive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make it better. When it doesnt exist, design it.\u00a0From that challenge, Phantom was born. And the result is the definition of automotive design and technological perfection. Phantom is a timeless interpretation of the modern luxury motor car. With its powerful stance, iconic proportions and state-of-the-art technology, its the signature Rolls-Royce. The engine delivers an abundance of effortless power\u00a0a magic carpet-like ride\u00a0that creates a driving experience like no other. But the pleasure begins even before you own a Phantom, as you can choose the personal features to make your motor car truly unique. This is a motor car to be commissioned, to represent your personal expression.The Phantom uses a unique chassis platform, body, interior, and retains traditional Rolls-Royce design cues. The body is mostly aluminium. \u00a0 Final assembly, including all body, paint, wood, and leather work, is completed to each customer's individual specification at the Rolls-Royce plant in Goodwood, West Sussex. The plant is close to the historic Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit.The aluminium extrusions that are used to construct the aluminium spaceframe are produced in Norway using hydroelectric power, shaped and machined in Denmark and finally hand-welded in Germany.The Phantom is 1.63 m (64.2 in) tall, 1.99 m (78.3 in) wide, 5.83 m (229.5 in) long, weighs 2,485 kg (5,478 lb) and can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.9 seconds. include a navigation system with voice recognition, power sunroof, upgraded leather upholstery, rear-view camera, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, 26-speaker premium sound system, 8-disc CD changer, 18-way power front seats, 16-way power rear seats, heated and cooled cup holders, rear-seat tables, outside-temperature indicator, universal garage door opener, power tilt/telescopic heated wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio, climate, and navigation controls, power open/close trunk lid, power closing doors, wireless headphones, iPod adapter, refrigerator, and air conditioning with 5-zone climate controls.

It includes fibre composites and special purpose steel body armour, thickened glass sheets in glazed area, polycarbonate layer, strengthened aluminium spaceframe chassis and suspension components.In 2004 Rolls Royce brought out perhaps their most important special edition cars. To celebrate the company's 100th Anniversary, Rolls Royce introduced the \"Phantom Centenary Edition\". This model was limited to only 35 units worldwide and was specifically commissioned by Rolls Royce. Most special edition cars are not commissioned by the factory, or are brought out to boost sales. This is not the case with the Centenary Edition. The car was debuted on May 4, 2004 at the Midland Hotel in Manchester. The Midland hotel holds special significance because it was the meeting place of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce. \u00a0", "author": "By arbaaz", "date": "On: Dec 23, 2016  | 83 Views"}

But if you're both rich and famous, that's another level of exclusivity altogether.The Phantom Limelight Collection ? a run of 25 specially-fitted Phantoms ? was \"conceived for that select group of people who spend their lives in the public eye and on the world stage,\" the company says in a press release. That starts with the rear doors, which have been fitted with special compartments: on the ladies' side, room for jewelry, on the men's side, a concealed space for watches. Both sides have room for three fragrances in handmade bottles imported from France's Bresle Valley: one each for morning, midday, and evening. I'm not aware of anyone who changes their fragrance depending on the time of day, but then again, I'm not a billionaire socialite.The Limelight also debuts a new type of rear seat for the Phantom that's apparently been optimized for relaxation through consultation with medical professionals, featuring a motorized calf rest, a 27-degree incline, and foot rests that pop out of the car's floor. Naturally, the car features Rolls-Royce's trademark Starlight headliner, which uses fiber optics to create a star pattern above the passengers. (Spaced separately, it's a five-figure option.)You can choose the Limelight in one of two color schemes ? Light and Dark ? but as with any Roller, money talks; you can most definitely have it your way, as long as the price is right.

One of the most desired saloons for the elite class, Bentley Flying Spur is the most powerful four-door sedan ever made by the British manufacturer. The car dropped the Continental,\u00a0prefix from its name for a number of reasons. One of them is the visual cues in the form of large outer lamps which are more sporty, lower front air dam, extra layers of chrome and more upright grille. But what matters the most is how well coddled you are inside the cabin. All the four seats are heated with massaging capability and finely stitched in leather. When I first stepped into the car, I saw the cabin as a lavish affair of wood and metal with central air conditioning system and high-resolution touchscreen infotainment. The powerful W12 engine still reminds of the continental badge with the mind-boggling output of 616bhp, that's enough to take this 2.5-tonne luxury from 0-100kmph in just 4.2 seconds.

{"modelSlug": "Bentley_Continental", "rating": 3, "title": "Bentleys handsome and affordable GT car", "content": "They came seemingly out of nowhere. Nearly 2800 feet above sea level and hours from the nearest city of consequence, a group of approximately four-dozen camera-wielding tourists of random nationalities spun on their heels and began to snap pictures of, well, us. The fact that we arrived at this Norwegian mountaintop overlook in a fleet of candy-hued 2016 Bentley Continental GT coupes may have contributed to their elation. Although we in the press are known for our handsome profiles and chiseled physiques, its hard to compete with the international language of horsepower, not to mention flawless paintwork and Bentleys stately Big B logo. \u00a0 While the attention was not entirely unexpected, that the tourists so hastily turned their backs on a glorious display of Mother Natures finest glacial carvings for a photo op with a car speaks volumes. Nobody was jockeying for prime photo real estate around the Ford Kuga parked next to us. \u00a0 For the first portion of the drive, we selected a Continental GT Speed cloaked in a dark hue known as Spectre.\u00a0Whether Bentley chose the name as an official reference to Ian Fleming supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld is up for debate, but it certainly plays the part well. What we can confirm, however, is that the torque swell from the 626-hp twin-turbo 6.0-liter W-12 remains as alluring as ever, all 607 lb-ft of torque on duty at 2000 rpm. Permanent all-wheel drive performs discreetly in the background, doling out torque as needed (normally split 40/60 front/rear, variable from 15/85 to 65/35 as conditions dictate). The resultant acceleration belies the GT Speeds 5100-pound curb weight, with 60 mph arriving in a claimed 4.0 seconds. Additional factory performance figures have 100 mph passing in a claimed 9.0 seconds and a top speed of 206 mph. From the long, linear travel of the accelerator (we like!) and the soft-ish brake pedal (don?t like so much), to the speed-sensitive electric power steering (like well enough) and damped but precise movement of the shift paddles (sure, why not?), the controls move as if they are mounted with bushings made of equal parts folding cash, Beluga caviar, and human tissue extracted from Barry Whites larynx. \u00a0 We Dont Like: Like nearly all very luxurious British automobiles (save, perhaps, McLarens), architectures and the models they spawn remain in the lineup long after age wouldve spelled death in more-competitive, mainstream segments. Its a syndrome that sometimes results in engaging accidental throwbacks like the refreshingly analog Aston Martin Vantage GT, but the Bentley winds up feeling a bit short of a charmingly quirky relic. Instead, it feels slightly out of phase with itself. \u00a0 Drive a Continental GT V8 S back-to-back with, say, a current Audi RS7, and the advances of the modern era are apparent. At this point, it appears Bentleys platform may be at the outer edge of its life span. \u00a0 As Bentley begins to tease its plans for the next generation Continental GT expected to arrive in 2018, with murmurings it will share the same underpinnings as the new Porsche Panamera, buyers currently have a vast choice of brilliant long-distance luxury cruisers at their disposal, something we have proven during our long-term test of the 4.0-litre V8 Continental GT. \u00a0", "author": "By ingurthi babji", "date": "On: Nov 22, 2016  | 73 Views"}

It is one of the greatest sports cars that houses a mighty engine inside. The exteriors are made to dazzle the onlookers with immense prowess on road. The capacity to strike the roads hard comes from the powerful 4.2L V8 engine that musters over 400 bhp and takes the car from naught to 100 in just 5.2 seconds.

After I drove the car, the curiosity to know about the brand, as well as the car, was ticking in my head. The Italian company had rather a bitter experience when they first forayed into the Indian market. Now with products like Levante and Quattroporte, the automaker is re-attempting to make its space in the market once again. The GTS I drove was a lovely car and I spent a lot of time only on staring at the dominating looks it has. It appears so commanding that performance and luxury seem to get fade away in the background. The dominating looks are complemented with the powerful V8 engine that takes this car from 0-100kmph in 4.7 seconds, which also makes it the fastest sedan from the Italian brand till date. The car can reach the top speed of 310kmph which is amazing, to say the least. The cabin is thoroughly luxurious with the rear space being a lounge. The 8.4inch multi-touch screen with voice commands and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay is a blessing. The decibels are handled by 10-speaker Harmon Kardon music system. The car scores well in all aspects but the fact remains that the vehicle is currently available only at Delhi dealership with Mumbai and Bangalore dealerships waiting to get the green signal.
