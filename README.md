A parser that collects information about all makes of cars from cardekho.com. This parser extracts the following data:

The name of the car brand;
Machine Brand Description;
Link to machine brand page;
Machine model name;
The year of the car model;
Machine Model Description;
Machine model characteristics;
The price of the car model;
Link to machine model page;
Pictures of a model car.

This parser uses the Python programming language and web scraping libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. First, the parser goes to the main page of cardekho.com and retrieves a list of all car brands using BeautifulSoup. Then for each car brand the parser goes to the brand page and retrieves the list of all car models.

For each car model, the parser has to go to the model page and retrieve the necessary data, such as name, year, description, features, price, link to the page and pictures.

All extracted data is saved to a json file or a database (your choice) for further processing. In addition, the parser can be configured to automatically update the information from the cardekho.com site to get the latest data on makes and models of cars.

Thus, the created parser will automate the collection and processing of information about makes and models of cars from the resource cardekho.com, which can be useful for market research, market analysis and other purposes.

I do not keep the code in the public domain, as it is my livelihood sorry).
